it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
so they performed 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
will be back again 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
this place has it 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
lousy product 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i am very happy 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
total brunch fail 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
not recommended 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
its really easy 1 
everything stinks 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
dont go here 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
very easy to use 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
portable and it works 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
a standout scene 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
never going back 0 
its just lame 0 
works for me 1 
dont buy this product 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
food was delicious 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
over rated 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
good audio quality 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
it is a true classic 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
so just beware 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i love this device 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
im not eating here 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
we wont be returning 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i really liked that 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i was so insulted 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
good show samsung 1 
what a waste 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
interesting decor 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
over rated 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
bad quality 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this game rocks 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
disappointing 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i would recommend it 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
price is good too 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
price is good too 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
works great 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the service was meh 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
highly recommended a 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i think not again 0 
item does not match picture 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the food was very good 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
worthwhile 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i would recommend this 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
does not fit 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
dont waste your time 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
good price 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
but its just not funny 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
im returning them 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
it is an insane game 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
im super pissd 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
price is good too 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
better than expected 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i was mortified 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
everything is appalling 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
id love to go back 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
lousy product 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
bad purchase 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
has been working great 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
really bad 0 
i loved it 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
we loved the place 1 
service is also cute 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
just does not work 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
damn good steak 1 
a bit predictable 0 
service was fantastic 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
hated it 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
youll love it 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
so far so good 1 
very easy to use 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
best headset ever 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
never going back 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
bad reception 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
wow loved this place 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
its just lame 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
left very frustrated 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
excellent phone 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it was awesome 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i liked it 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i never come again 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the food was terrible 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
worst thai ever 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i heart this place 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
simply beautiful 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
absolutely great 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
sooooo good 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
so they performed 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
will definitely be back 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
nice sound 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
terrible management 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i would recommend this 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i love this thing 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
bad reception 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
a great touch 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its not user friendly 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
works well 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the food amazing 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i would recommend this 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
there is no real plot 0 
dont buy it 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the food is good 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
will not be back 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
its aggravating 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
not easy to watch 0 
works great 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
there is no real plot 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
hated it 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great hands free device 1 
great audio 1 
its pretty easy 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
lousy product 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i was mortified 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it works 1 
not impressed 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
battery life is real good 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the battery works great 1 
a disappointment 0 
absolutel junk 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
great product 1 
it was delicious 1 
not impressed 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i think not again 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
price is good too 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
will definitely be back 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
great earpiece 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
id like to return it 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
dont buy it 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great phone 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i love it 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
its pretty easy 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
my order was not correct 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
sooooo good 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
would not go back 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
lousy product 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i wont be back 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
worst martini ever 0 
we wont be returning 0 
very good though 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
not my thing 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it was so funny 1 
works well 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
warning stay away 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
great price also 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
not enough volume 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
poor sound quality 0 
interesting decor 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
not enough volume 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
great audio 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
im super pissd 0 
service was fantastic 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
worst thai ever 0 
will order from them again 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
made very sturdy 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
poor construction 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
well never go again 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
we are sending it back 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
love this headset 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
wont go back 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
very poor service 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
see it 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
service is also cute 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it was so boring 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
will not be back 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i love this thing 1 
its just lame 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
we wont be going back 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
its a great item 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i heart this place 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
will never ever go back 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
is pretty funny 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
go watch it 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the food amazing 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
very very fun chef 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
poor quality 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
that was funny 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
bad purchase 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i love this device 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i think not again 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
nice sound 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
will not be back 0 
does not fit 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
works as described 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i consider this theft 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
nothing special 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
sending it back 0 
amazon sucks 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
its aggravating 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
works well 1 
we wont be going back 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
this case seems well made 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
mediocre food 0 
incredible 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
left very frustrated 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it is a true classic 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i loved it 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
horrible phone 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
simply beautiful 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the food amazing 1 
crust is not good 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
he was terrible 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
good price 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
omit watching this 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
lousy product 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
what a mistake 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
not worth it 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i heart this place 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
absolutely great 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
food was really boring 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
really ugly 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
horrible phone 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
doesnt work 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
awesome device 1 
that company is a joke 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
will not be back 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
bad reception 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
bad purchase 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
battery life is also great 1 
this game rocks 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
everything was gross 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
poor sound quality 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
works great 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
horrible phone 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
very disappointing 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
has been working great 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
amazon sucks 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
very disappointing 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
very good quality though 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
will order from them again 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
five star plus plus 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
good price 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
great phone 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great price too 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
food was really boring 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i want my money back 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
a great touch 1 
we loved the place 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
very good though 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
good product incredible value 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
what a mistake 0 
what a mistake 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
it was not good 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
im not eating here 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the portion was huge 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
its a total package 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
worst martini ever 0 
gets the job done 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i love this thing 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
see it 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
so bad 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
well never go again 0 
never got it 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
doesnt work 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
not what i wanted 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
good audio quality 1 
i love this device 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
really bad 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great value 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it was horrible 0 
totally believable 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this place has it 1 
not easy to watch 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i am very happy 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
worst martini ever 0 
1010 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it looks very nice 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i wont be back 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
does not work 0 
extremely tasty 1 
crust is not good 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
con spotty service 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the block was amazing 1 
terrible management 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this place is good 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
poor product 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
does not work 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
does not work 0 
battery life is also great 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
last time buying from you 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
terrible management 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
it is not good 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
service is also cute 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
good show samsung 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
awsome device works great 1 
they are so cool 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
really awful 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
you cant beat that 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
works well 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i want my money back 0 
interesting decor 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
made very sturdy 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
excellent performance 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
very very sad 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
really bad 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
does not fit 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it was not good 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
battery has no life 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it was not good 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
again no plot at all 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
this place is great 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
worthless product 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
they are so cool 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the food was very good 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it was horrible 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
buttons are too small 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
a disappointment 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
buttons are too small 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
good show samsung 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
totally believable 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
very friendly staff 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
is pretty funny 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
that company is a joke 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
nice design and quality 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
just what i wanted 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
very good though 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1
