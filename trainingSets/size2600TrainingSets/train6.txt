this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
excellent phone 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
piece of junk 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
worst ever 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
would not go back 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
its just lame 0 
worthless product 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
will not be back 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
he was terrible 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
battery has no life 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
great choice 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
portable and it works 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
it just blew 0 
i am very happy 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this game rocks 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
it was equally awful 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
interesting decor 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
excellent phone 1 
great hands free device 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
we are sending it back 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the fries were great too 1 
was not happy 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
great price also 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
everything was gross 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
dont buy it 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
warning stay away 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
worst thai ever 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
buttons are too small 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
food was average at best 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
too politically correct 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
worth every penny 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
youll love it 1 
worked perfectly 1 
not recommended 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
did not like at all 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
would recommend this item 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
great product 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
they were excellent 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
very happy with this product 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
good quality 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
food was below average 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
well im satisfied 1 
mediocre food 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
very bad experience 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
just does not work 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
happy so far 1 
very good phone 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
service is also cute 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
service is also cute 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it looks very nice 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
waitress was good though 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
made very sturdy 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i am very happy 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
service stinks here 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
dont waste your money 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i think not again 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this pda rocks 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
very bad experience 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
its really easy 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
love this headset 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
great price too 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
its aggravating 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
check it out 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the mic is great 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
item does not match picture 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
excellent service 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
interesting decor 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
absolutely great 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
a good time 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
disappointing experience 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the design is very good4 1 
service was very prompt 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
wasted two hours 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
would not reccommend 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i love this thing 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
fast service 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
awesome service and food 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this phone works great 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
is pretty funny 1 
best headset ever 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
left very frustrated 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
well im satisfied 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
dont buy it 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
works great 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
its just painful 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
im pleased 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
great product 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
not recommended 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the film is way too long 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
great case and price 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
do not waste your time 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
disappointing 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
how awful she is 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
great value 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
how stupid is that 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
did not like at all 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
highly recommended a 1 
bad purchase 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
very disappointed 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
great product 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
never got it 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
totally believable 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
great product for the price 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
incredible 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
great phone 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
battery is terrible 0 
im not eating here 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
five star plus plus 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
wont go back 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
great phone 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
not good for the money 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it was packed 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
sending it back 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
kind of flops around 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
lousy product 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it was packed 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
do not waste your time 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
they are so cool 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
absolutely great 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
great food 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
great phone 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
price is good too 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
so just beware 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
very disappointed 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
that movie was bad 0 
it was equally awful 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
im pleased 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
see it 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
portable and it works 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this place lacked style 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
really bad 0 
the food is good 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
great price too 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i love this place 1 
very funny 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
great phone 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the acting was bad 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
go rent it 1 
nice ambiance 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
they were excellent 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
that was funny 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
good item low price 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
just does not work 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
sending it back 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
they were excellent 1 
good show samsung 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i consider this theft 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
its really easy 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
love this product 1 
its a total package 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the food amazing 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i was so insulted 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
love this headset 1 
buttons are too small 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
battery is terrible 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
piece of junk 0 
highly recommended a 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i am very happy 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
food was below average 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
too politically correct 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
great hands free device 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
very good quality though 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
owners are really great people 1 
very good quality though 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
good case excellent value 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
piece of junk 0 
sooooo good 1 
not impressed 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
again lame 0 
good item low price 1 
great phone 1 
piece of junk 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
doesnt work 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
awsome device works great 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the acting was bad 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
1010 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
love this headset 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
it was so boring 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
fantastic food 1 
did not like at all 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
1010 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
im super pissd 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
great choice 1 
both great 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the block was amazing 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
would recommend this item 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
very disappointing 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
awsome device works great 1 
great product 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
bad choice 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
1010 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
great product and price 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
great phone 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
really good product 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
buttons are too small 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
see it 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
has been working great 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
good item low price 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
its a total package 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
not good for the money 0 
works good 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
there is no real plot 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
everything was gross 0 
good price 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
dont buy this product 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
does not fit 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
good audio quality 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
kind of flops around 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
we wont be going back 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
would not go back 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
its just painful 0 
youll love it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
sooooo good 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
it is a true classic 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
bad purchase 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
great phone 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
dont waste your time 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
its very slow 0 
they have great dinners 1 
worked great 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
its aggravating 0 
very easy to use 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
has been working great 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
hated it 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the acting was bad 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
bad purchase 0 
overall a great experience 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
really bad 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
they were excellent 1 
what a mistake 0 
worst ever 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
will definitely be back 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
really good product 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i loved it 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
great case and price 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
magical help 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
worst ever 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
poor reliability 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
very prompt service 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
love this phone 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i heart this place 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
great for ipods too 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
service was very prompt 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
it was not good 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
my order was not correct 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
piece of trash 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
but i dont like it 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
poor construction 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
portable and it works 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
good show samsung 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
great phone 1 
very very sad 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
poor reliability 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
how awful she is 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i would recommend this 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
fantastic food 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
interesting decor 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
disappointed 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the acting was bad 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
nice design and quality 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
a standout scene 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
so just beware 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
too politically correct 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
we wont be going back 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
great phone 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the design is very good4 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the design is very good4 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
happy so far 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
awful 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
worth every penny 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
highly recommended 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
its just lame 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1

if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
we are sending it back 0 
the problem was the script 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0

it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1

the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1

this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0

im still trying to get over how bad it was 0

steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
nothing special 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1

sooooo good 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
disappointing experience 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
battery life is also great 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
its just lame 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
great phone 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
everything was gross 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
defective crap 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
see it 1 
battery life is also great 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
great earpiece 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
warning stay away 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
we wont be going back 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
dont miss it 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
very happy with this product 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
go rent it 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
very disappointing 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
excellent 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0
