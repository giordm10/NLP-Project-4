i love this bluetooth 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
again no plot at all 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this is a great phone 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
happy so far 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
they are so cool 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
kind of flops around 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
too politically correct 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
very prompt service 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
total waste of time 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
50 down the drain 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
battery is terrible 0 
very poor service 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
magical help 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
battery has no life 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
great product for the price 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
a good time 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it was way over fried 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
never going back 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
id like to return it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
great service and food 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
love this phone 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
a good time 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
poor product 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
not good for the money 0 
awsome device works great 1 
will not be back 0 
awful service 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
left very frustrated 0 
very disappointing 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
do not waste your time 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
con spotty service 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
this place is good 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
doesnt last long 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
does not fit 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
poor reliability 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
worst customer service 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
not worth it 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
very funny 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
eclectic selection 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
will order from them again 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
its pretty easy 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
works for me 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
gets the job done 1 
gets the job done 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
truly awful 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
that was funny 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
poor quality 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
damn good steak 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
good servicecheck 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
good food good service 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
love this product 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
a great touch 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
this is a good joint 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this case seems well made 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
so far so good 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this is a great little item 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this case seems well made 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
great price also 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
good item low price 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
go rent it 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
service sucks 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
good case 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
love this phone 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
very displeased 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the best phone in market 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
very bad experience 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not worth it 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
brilliant 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
poor product 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
extremely tasty 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
but its just not funny 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
doesnt work 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great movie 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
it just blew 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
great product for the price 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
terrible service 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
1010 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
sending it back 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
poor construction 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
worst customer service 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
omit watching this 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
awful 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i loved it 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
it was equally awful 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
gets the job done 1 
service was very prompt 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it was so cool 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
youll love it 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the best phone in market 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
50 down the drain 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the design is very good4 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
so bad 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it was so funny 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
good food good service 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this place is good 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
so bad 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
piece of trash 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
great price also 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
id like to return it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
sending it back 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
great earpiece 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
great value 1 
poor reliability 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
love it great armband 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
not my thing 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the design is very good4 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
and it was boring 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
not easy to watch 0 
poor quality 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
good price 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
love this product 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
give this one a look 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the problem was the script 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i never come again 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
its a total package 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
best headset ever 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
piece of trash 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
fantastic food 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
how awful she is 0 
not good for the money 0

the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1

the films dialogue is natural real to life 1

its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1

basically the service was very bad 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
very happy with this product 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
krussel always good 1 
worst customer service 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
good audio quality 1 
great price too 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
was not happy 0 
total waste of time 0 
nothing special 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
what a disappointment 0 
good food good service 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
does not work 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
good product incredible value 1 
worked great 1 
food was delicious 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
a great touch 1 
horrible 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
great movie 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
very prompt service 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i love this place 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
worked great 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
love this product 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is a great little item 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
works great 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
we wont be returning 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
total waste of time 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
delicious 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
used and dirty 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
piece of junk 0 
worked perfectly 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
it worked very well 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
a good time 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
disappointing experience 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
omit watching this 0 
great product for the price 1 
the food amazing 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
this place has it 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very easy to use 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
bad purchase 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i want my money back 0 
do not waste your time 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
dont buy it 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
and it was boring 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i waited and waited 0 
works great 1 
very bad experience 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
good price 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
its really easy 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
incredible 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
awful 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
both great 1 
there is no real plot 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the cast is good 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the block was amazing 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
hated it 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i love this thing 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the mic is great 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
awful service 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
worst martini ever 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
her role was played well 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
piece of junk 0 
it was equally awful 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
works great 1 
and it was boring 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
waste of money 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
poor quality 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
excellent product 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
it was so boring 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i love this device 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
how awful she is 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
terrible management 0 
poor reliability 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the food amazing 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
painful on the ear 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
excellent short film 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
they are so cool 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
so they performed 1 
it was equally awful 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it was delicious 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
works well 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
great phone 1 
this place is great 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
truly awful 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
good case excellent value 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
a good time 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
very good phone 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
will be back again 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
great service and food 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
not impressed 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
con spotty service 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
works great 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i love this place 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
very displeased 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
dont go here 0 
mediocre food 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
it is a true classic 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
made very sturdy 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
im returning them 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
service is also cute 1 
poor construction 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
good quality 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
im not eating here 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
very disappointing 0 
doesnt work 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
we loved the place 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
delicious 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
very good phone 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
very good phone 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i am very happy 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
well im satisfied 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
works well 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it was so funny 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
crisp and clear 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
works for me 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
great product and price 1 
a standout scene 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
very bad experience 0 
worst martini ever 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
very disappointing 0 
well im satisfied 1 
left very frustrated 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
mediocre food 0 
worked great 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
good quality 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
gets the job done 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
worked great 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
terrible service 0 
a disappointment 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
great product and price 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
very funny 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
dont waste your time 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
works fine 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
excellent performance 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
awsome device works great 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
would not go back 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
worked great 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
bad reception 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
not what i wanted 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the cast is good 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
awesome device 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it was way over fried 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
fantastic food 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its really easy 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
we wont be returning 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
portable and it works 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
dont go here 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it is an insane game 1 
great earpiece 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
works great 1 
poor sound quality 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it was horrendous 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
so they performed 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
dont waste your money 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
waste of money 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i would recommend this 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
fantastic food 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i really liked that 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i heart this place 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the management is rude 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
good quality 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
love this headset 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
service sucks 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this place lacked style 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
not easy to watch 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0
