well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
good servicecheck 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
buttons are too small 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
nothing new there 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the food is good 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
worth every penny 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
so far so good 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i am very happy 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
go and see it 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
terrible service 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i never come again 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it was equally awful 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
everything was gross 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
1010 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
great value 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
im pleased 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
check it out 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the best phone in market 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
service is also cute 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
disappointed 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
waste of money 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i love it 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
and it was boring 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
bad choice 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
what a mistake 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i think not again 0 
very prompt service 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
works great 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
a standout scene 1 
piece of junk 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
good audio quality 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
really awful 0 
great phone 1 
battery has no life 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
was not happy 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
so far so good 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
disapointing results 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
awsome device works great 1 
sooooo good 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
soggy and not good 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
works good 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
great phone 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
it was so cool 1 
worth every penny 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
very good product well made 1 
its just lame 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the portion was huge 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
doesnt last long 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
well never go again 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
will not be back 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the portion was huge 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the best phone in market 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
what a waste 0 
what a waste 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
do not waste your time 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
so bad 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the food amazing 1 
works great 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
works great 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i never come again 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
will not be back 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
it works 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
works fine 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
this is a great deal 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
very friendly staff 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
bad choice 0 
disapointing results 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
great product for the price 1 
will be back again 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
its just lame 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
really awful 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
low quality 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
battery life is real good 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
disappointed 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
excellent phone 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
warning stay away 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
they have great dinners 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
you cant beat that 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
service stinks here 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
so far so good 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i think not again 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
how awful she is 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this movie is bad 0 
great phone 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
go rent it 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
worst martini ever 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
just does not work 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the service was meh 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
give this one a look 1 
amazon sucks 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this game rocks 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
highly recommended a 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
was not happy 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this is a great little item 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
great product 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
he was terrible 0 
great hands free device 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
works well 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
id love to go back 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
mediocre food 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
great bluetooth 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
not recommended 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
great brunch spot 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
battery has no life 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
good prices 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
her role was played well 1 
its really easy 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
wont go back 0 
we loved the place 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
so far so good 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it was horrendous 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
not recommended 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
waste of money 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
bad choice 0 
i wont be back 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
disappointing 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
very prompt service 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
would not go back 0 
the phone loads super 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
and it was boring 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
very prompt service 1 
disappointing experience 0 
again lame 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
poor reliability 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
it was delicious 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
never got it 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
was not happy 0 
nice sound 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
not worth it 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
no real improvement 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
total waste of time 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i was so insulted 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
great phone 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
so they performed 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
very disappointed 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
great price too 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
well never go again 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
battery has no life 0 
i love this device 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
that movie was bad 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
id love to go back 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
disappointing 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
a great touch 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
you wont regret it 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
very very sad 0 
horrible phone 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
works great 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
cool phone 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
service sucks 0 
its just lame 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
great hands free device 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
dont waste your time 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
great phone 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
disapointing results 0 
no real improvement 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
what a waste 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
works great 1 
and it was boring 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
awful service 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
awful 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
we wont be going back 0 
nice leather 1 
great product for the price 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
great phone 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
great choice 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
painful on the ear 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it looks very nice 1 
good case 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
dont buy it 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
too politically correct 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
brilliant 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
stay away from the q 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its really easy 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
sweetest phone 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the best phone in market 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
they are so cool 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
this place is great 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
not impressed 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
very displeased 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
excellent short film 1 
omit watching this 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
go watch it 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
what a waste 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
incredible 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i love this place 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
made very sturdy 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
very disappointing 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
awesome device 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
con spotty service 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
worst martini ever 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i will not return 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
very disappointed 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it just blew 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
great service and food 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the food is good 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
dont buy it 0 
i wont be back 0 
i would recommend it 1 
it was delicious 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
its really easy 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
go rent it 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
piece of trash 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i am very happy 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the service was meh 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
painful on the ear 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
well im satisfied 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
works good 1 
total waste of time 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
id love to go back 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
we wont be returning 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
poor reliability 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i love this place 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
good show samsung 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
awful 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it works 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the service was meh 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
over rated 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
very funny 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
great price also 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the cast is good 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
waitress was good though 1 
just does not work 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
her role was played well 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
works well 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
omit watching this 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
this case seems well made 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great phone 1 
awesome device 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the cast was great 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
wont go back 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
see it 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
fast service 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
really ugly 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
very good product well made 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
really ugly 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
worthwhile 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
this case seems well made 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
total brunch fail 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
food was delicious 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
terrible management 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
they were excellent 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
dont buy it 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
we are sending it back 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
worthless product 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
we are sending it back 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
very easy to use 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
good product incredible value 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
awesome service and food 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
give this one a look 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
its aggravating 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
incredible 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
dont waste your money 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
excellent short film 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
im pleased 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
works fine 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
disappointed 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
great product for the price 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this place is good 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it just blew 0 
battery has no life 0 
food was delicious 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
not worth it 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
her role was played well 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
too politically correct 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
you wont regret it 1 
excellent short film 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
worst ever 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
a great touch 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
doesnt last long 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
incredible 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
great earpiece 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
really ugly 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
will order from them again 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
has been working great 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
great value 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
and it was boring 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
youll love it 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
this place is great 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
very disappointing 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
easy to use 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
overall a great experience 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
good product good seller 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
great product 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
im returning them 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
great value 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
very disappointing 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
great product 1 
not worth it 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
kind of flops around 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
wow loved this place 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
dont buy this product 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
magical help 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
dont waste your time 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
bad choice 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
good prices 1 
will not be back 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
they were excellent 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
very friendly staff 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
again no plot at all 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
extremely tasty 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
its really easy 1 
i love this thing 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
im returning them 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
works well 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
very easy to use 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
awsome device works great 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
brilliant 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
better than new 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
so they performed 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
just what i wanted 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
it was horrendous 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
wont go back 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
but its just not funny 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
worthless product 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the acting sucked 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
never going back 0 
why was this film made 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
what a mistake 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this place lacked style 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
disapointing results 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the food is good 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
very displeased 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
poor quality and service 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this case seems well made 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
very friendly staff 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
owners are really great people 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
im super pissd 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
what a mistake 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
five star plus plus 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
will not be back 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0
