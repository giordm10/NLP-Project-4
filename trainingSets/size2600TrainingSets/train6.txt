it was probably dirt 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
excellent service 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
brilliant 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it was equally awful 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
wow loved this place 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
brilliant 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
excellent short film 1 
easy to use 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
what a waste 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
this is a good joint 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
it was not good 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
great phone 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
service sucks 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
we wont be returning 0 
highly recommended a 1 
nothing new there 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
absolutely great 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
very windresistant 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
very good though 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
great sound and service 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
very disappointing 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
1010 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
dont go here 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
great phone 1 
great earpiece 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i love it 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
horrible 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i paid too much 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
omit watching this 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
good audio quality 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
its just painful 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
great phone 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
really ugly 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
did not like at all 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
good case 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
has been working great 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
everything was gross 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
very funny 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
id love to go back 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
service sucks 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
really bad 0 
we wont be going back 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
portable and it works 1 
really ugly 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
im not eating here 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
awful service 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
excellent phone 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
nothing new there 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
would not go back 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
everything is appalling 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i love this device 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
very disappointing 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this is a great phone 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
he was terrible 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
will never ever go back 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
disappointing 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
simply beautiful 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
service sucks 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i think not again 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
very windresistant 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
love it great armband 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the mic is great 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
good price 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
they were excellent 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
disappointing 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i think not again 0 
this place lacked style 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
there is no real plot 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
nice sound 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
fast service 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
service was fantastic 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
will not be back 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the food was very good 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
very prompt service 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
worst thai ever 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
wow loved this place 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the design is very good4 1 
great case and price 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i waited and waited 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it was so cool 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
worst customer service 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
kind of flops around 0 
it worked very well 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
how awful she is 0 
the battery works great 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
and it was boring 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
has been working great 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i liked it 1 
good item low price 1 
will not be back 0 
the mic is great 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
fantastic food 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
very easy to use 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
worthless product 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
dont waste your money 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
just what i wanted 1 
good works fine 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
its pretty easy 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this place is great 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
good servicecheck 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
see both films if you can 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
but i dont like it 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
not impressed 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i was so insulted 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
does not fit 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
very friendly staff 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
dont buy this product 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
not recommended 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
worst martini ever 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
would not reccommend 0 
there is no real plot 0 
service stinks here 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
worst customer service 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
portable and it works 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this is a great little item 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
extremely tasty 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
great phone 1 
poor product 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the problem was the script 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
great audio 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
totally believable 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the problem was the script 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
better than youd expect 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
awesome service and food 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
1010 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
i heart this place 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
did not like at all 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
wont go back 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
nice leather 1 
very windresistant 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
magical help 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
there is no real plot 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great hands free device 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
how awesome is that 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
a pretty good product 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the management is rude 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i love it 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
very good phone 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
both great 1 
the cast was great 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
lousy product 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
they have great dinners 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i love it 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
does not work 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
doesnt work 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
great earpiece 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
great phone 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
great phone 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
piece of junk 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it is an insane game 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
great price also 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
was not happy 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
a good time 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the problem was the script 0 
what a waste 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
warning stay away 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
very prompt service 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
im pleased 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
great hands free device 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
youll love it 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
not recommended 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
love this product 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
nice sound 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
worthwhile 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i love this place 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
go watch it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the service was meh 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
you wont regret it 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
piece of trash 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
just does not work 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
good value great food great service 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
fast service 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
great brunch spot 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
total brunch fail 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great food 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
poor product 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
good item low price 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
defective crap 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
good quality 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
awesome service and food 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
good audio quality 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
he was terrible 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
kind of flops around 0 
great product 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
what a waste of time 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
very disappointing 0 
it was not good 0 
great product for the price 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i love this place 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
works well 1 
dont waste your money 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
kind of flops around 0 
poor construction 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
youll love it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
wow loved this place 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent phone 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
service sucks 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
bad choice 0 
her role was played well 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
works great 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great service and food 1 
wont go back 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i wont be back 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it worked very well 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
so they performed 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
great hands free device 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
doesnt work 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
great charger 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
buttons are too small 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i am very happy 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
low quality 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
give this one a look 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
not recommended 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
great hands free device 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
great audio 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
very very fun chef 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
worthwhile 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
battery life is also great 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
battery has no life 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
better than youd expect 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i wont be back 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
so they performed 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
so they performed 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
eclectic selection 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this movie is bad 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
so just beware 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
really ugly 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
works great 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
worst thai ever 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
great earpiece 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
great for ipods too 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
owners are really great people 1 
its just painful 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
great sound and service 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
horrible 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
very easy to use 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
great for ipods too 1 
works well 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
excellent 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
very comfortable 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
left very frustrated 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
great movie 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
good product incredible value 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
its really easy 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
worst customer service 0 
owners are really great people 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
very disappointed 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
good product good seller 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
works great 1 
1010 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
dont waste your time 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
terrible service 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
absolutely great 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
works fine 1 
good show samsung 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
good show samsung 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
this place is great 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
good item low price 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
service was fantastic 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
is pretty funny 1 
excellent 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
never going back 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the food amazing 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
highly recommended 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
nothing new there 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
horrible phone 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
defective crap 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
give this one a look 1 
great food 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
not enough volume 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
good quality 1 
very friendly staff 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
dont waste your money 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
does not work 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
poor sound quality 0 
great phone 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i love this phone 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
design flaw 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
youll love it 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the management is rude 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
im pleased 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
its a great item 1 
better than youd expect 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
very easy to use 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
overall a great experience 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
is pretty funny 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
does not fit 0 
this place is amazing 1 
brilliant 1 
brilliant 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
works well 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
1010 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
do not waste your time 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it was equally awful 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
service sucks 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
great brunch spot 1 
dont do it 0 
these are fabulous 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
very disappointed 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
and it was boring 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
waste of money 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this is a great deal 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
they were excellent 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i never come again 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
well never go again 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
well im satisfied 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
works for me 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
mediocre food 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
will order from them again 1 
works great 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
see it 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
that company is a joke 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
totally believable 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
im super pissd 0 
you cant beat that 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very friendly staff 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
did not like at all 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
he was terrible 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
worked great 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the best phone in market 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
and it was boring 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i really liked that 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0
