ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i was mortified 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
mediocre food 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
just what i wanted 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i love this phone 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
poor product 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
stay away from the q 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this movie is bad 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
everything is appalling 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
very easy to use 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
very happy with this product 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
disapointing results 0 
fast service 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it was so boring 0 
bad quality 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
its really easy 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
terrible management 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
we wont be returning 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
defective crap 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
total waste of time 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
worst ever 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
great product and price 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
its just painful 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
worst phone ever 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
go and see it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
how awful she is 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
how awful she is 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
sending it back 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
very good product well made 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the design is very good4 1 
this place is amazing 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
kind of flops around 0 
five star plus plus 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
better than new 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
its aggravating 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
it is an insane game 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
im super pissd 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i am very happy 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
that was nice 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
best headset ever 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
this pda rocks 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i heart this place 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
it was packed 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
fantastic food 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
does not fit 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
great brunch spot 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
highly recommended 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
no real improvement 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
very good though 1 
food was really boring 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
last time buying from you 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
works great 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i consider this theft 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i love this phone 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
a disappointment 0 
dont waste your money 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the portion was huge 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the poor actors 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
how awful she is 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it works 1 
i liked it 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
its not user friendly 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
poor construction 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it looks very nice 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
im super pissd 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the acting sucked 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
never going back 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
great phone 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
go and see it 1 
this place is good 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
dont buy it 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
not enough volume 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
why was this film made 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
total waste of time 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
will not be back 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
piece of junk 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
warning stay away 0 
works fine 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
worst martini ever 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
very good product well made 1 
what a waste 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
will definitely be back 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
worth every penny 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
cumbersome design 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
absolutely great 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
so they performed 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
service was very prompt 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
that company is a joke 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i liked it 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
did not like at all 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
price is good too 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
dont waste your time 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i would recommend this 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
works great 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
hated it 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
a disappointment 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the block was amazing 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
worth every penny 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
horrible phone 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
not easy to watch 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
good servicecheck 1 
very very fun chef 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
good prices 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
it is shameful 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
food was really boring 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
a disappointment 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
does not work 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
a disappointment 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
never got it 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
waitress was good though 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
both great 1 
works great 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
that was nice 1 
really ugly 0 
better than new 1 
piece of junk 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
just what i wanted 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
its aggravating 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
give this one a look 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
worth every penny 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
this place is amazing 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
overall a great experience 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
im not eating here 0 
its aggravating 0 
very disappointing 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
battery has no life 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
nice sound 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
great phone 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
worst customer service 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
a pretty good product 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
great value 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
will be back again 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
worked great 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
defective crap 0 
service sucks 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
good case 1 
that was nice 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
everything is appalling 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
over rated 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
incredible 1 
it is a true classic 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
great phone 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
awful service 0 
over rated 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this is a great little item 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
disappointing 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
very funny 1 
used and dirty 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this pda rocks 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
poor quality and service 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
magical help 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the service was meh 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
dont miss it 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
piece of junk 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
this is infuriating 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
kind of flops around 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
great price too 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
very windresistant 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
piece of junk 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the cast was great 1 
very funny 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
just what i wanted 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i think not again 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
absolutel junk 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
piece of junk 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i was mortified 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
very friendly staff 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
total brunch fail 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
doesnt work 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
does not work 0 
bad purchase 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
very displeased 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
but its just not funny 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
doesnt last long 0 
very poor service 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
its just lame 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
piece of junk 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
im not eating here 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
damn good steak 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great price also 1 
this is a good joint 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
disappointing experience 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the problem was the script 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i want my money back 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
food was average at best 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
great charger 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
good prices 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
its aggravating 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
sending it back 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
was not happy 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
terrible service 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
not recommended 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
stay away from the q 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
dont waste your time 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
doesnt last long 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
go watch it 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it was packed 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
its a total package 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
great food 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the problem was the script 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
that was nice 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
will not be back 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
its a total package 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
what a mistake 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i wont be back 0 
service stinks here 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
very bad experience 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
total brunch fail 0 
nice sound 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
its really easy 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
really awful 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i think not again 0 
just what i wanted 1 
works great 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
warning do not buy 0 
magical help 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
great earpiece 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
great phone 1 
wow loved this place 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
has been working great 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
nothing new there 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
bad purchase 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
again no plot at all 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
excellent service 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
design flaw 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
this place lacked style 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
a disappointment 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
either way it sucks 0 
krussel always good 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i would recommend it 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
everything was gross 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
five star plus plus 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
food was average at best 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
truly awful 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was so insulted 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
not worth it 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
portable and it works 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the food amazing 1 
a great touch 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
total waste of time 0 
very happy with this product 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
extremely tasty 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
does not fit 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
food was delicious 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i love this place 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
nothing special 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
what a waste 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
so bad 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
works great 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
a disappointment 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
overall a great experience 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
great product 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
poor quality and service 0 
excellent performance 1 
works fine 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great phone 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
sweetest phone 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
its really easy 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
works great 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
very disappointing 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
id like to return it 0 
just does not work 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
will order from them again 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
doesnt work 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
good audio quality 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
food was delicious 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
it was so funny 1 
works great 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
you wont regret it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this place is great 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
not my thing 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
service sucks 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
dont buy this product 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the block was amazing 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
cumbersome design 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
not enough volume 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
works great 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
mediocre food 0 
excellent phone 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
its pretty easy 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i wont be back 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
omit watching this 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
dont do it 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i love it 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
dont go here 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
poor product 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
dont go here 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
has been working great 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
a disappointment 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
disapointing results 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
sweetest phone 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
total waste of time 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
interesting decor 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
five star plus plus 1 
poor product 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i never come again 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
overall a great experience 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
they have great dinners 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the food was very good 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
food was average at best 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
works great 1 
it was so funny 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
this place is great 1 
used and dirty 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
better than new 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i love this thing 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
incredible 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this pda rocks 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i consider this theft 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it just blew 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
bad choice 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it works 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1
