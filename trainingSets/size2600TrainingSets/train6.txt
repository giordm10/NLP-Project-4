and the sound quality is great 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
service was fantastic 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
highly recommended 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the food was terrible 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
works as described 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
they have great dinners 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
very disappointing 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
poor reliability 0 
has been working great 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
not recommended 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
good prices 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
very comfortable 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
really good product 1 
the acting sucked 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
wasted two hours 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
great audio 1 
just what i wanted 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
so they performed 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
how awesome is that 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
go rent it 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
you wont regret it 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
go watch it 1 
everything was gross 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
will be back again 1 
this pda rocks 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the food is good 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
not impressed 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
worked great 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
worst ever 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
over rated 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this pda rocks 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
really ugly 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
has been working great 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
works well 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the phone loads super 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
sooooo good 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this place is great 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
poor product 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
con spotty service 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
you cant beat that 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
will not be back 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the food was terrible 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
not good for the money 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
great product 1 
i liked it 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
awsome device works great 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
warning do not buy 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the cast was great 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
made very sturdy 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
so bad 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
go and see it 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
battery has no life 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it was horrible 0 
works well 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
service stinks here 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i never come again 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
poor sound quality 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
excellent performance 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great phone 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
go rent it 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
disappointed 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
works great 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
you wont regret it 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
does not fit 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the food is good 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
nice design and quality 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
very funny 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
incredible 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
poor product 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
painful on the ear 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
good food good service 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
not impressed 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
excellent short film 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
either way it sucks 0 
its just lame 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
nice leather 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
bad quality 0 
food was below average 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
overall a delight 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
nothing special 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
good item low price 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
brilliant 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
worked perfectly 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the mic is great 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i love this device 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
worthwhile 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
battery life is also great 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
nothing special 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
piece of junk 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
it was not good 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
portable and it works 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
poor sound quality 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
waste of money 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i will not return 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
great phone 1 
not enough volume 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the acting sucked 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
great price too 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
does not work 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
good works fine 1 
stay away from the q 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
fantastic service here 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
do not waste your time 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
was not happy 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
nice design and quality 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the food was very good 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
not a good bargain 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its pretty easy 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
great service and food 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
go watch it 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
worthless product 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
great phone 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the problem was the script 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
easy to use 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i would recommend this 1 
this is a good joint 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
very comfortable 1 
mediocre food 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
love this product 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
very prompt service 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
very disappointing 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
worst martini ever 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
a good time 1 
i wont be back 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i will not return 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
excellent product 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
portable and it works 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
painful on the ear 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
battery life is also great 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
too politically correct 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
disappointing 0 
i want my money back 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
love this headset 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the management is rude 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
id like to return it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this phone works great 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
youll love it 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
everything was gross 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
excellent performance 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
you wont regret it 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the food was terrible 0 
defective crap 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
service sucks 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
great product 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the film is way too long 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
happy so far 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
disappointing 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
truly awful 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the cast was great 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
what a waste 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
not worth it 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
works great 1 
we loved the place 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
food was below average 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
a great touch 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
works great 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
everything stinks 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
1010 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
why was this film made 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
either way it sucks 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
portable and it works 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
simply beautiful 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
go and see it 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i love this device 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i loved it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
bad choice 0 
great phone 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the food is good 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
dont buy it 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
disappointing 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
nice ambiance 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
go and see it 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
great phone 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
so they performed 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
everything was gross 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
love this headset 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
everything stinks 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
great sound and service 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
fast service 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it was so boring 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
excellent product 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
youll love it 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
we loved the place 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
service was very prompt 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
disappointed 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the portion was huge 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
worked perfectly 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
piece of junk 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
her role was played well 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
there is no real plot 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
very windresistant 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the problem was the script 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
was not happy 0 
con spotty service 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
a great touch 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
doesnt last long 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
warning stay away 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
great case and price 1 
its just lame 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
worst thai ever 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
really bad 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
its pretty easy 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
nice leather 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
last time buying from you 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
disappointing experience 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
really ugly 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
food was average at best 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
very easy to use 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
made very sturdy 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
this is a great little item 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
works as described 1 
good product good seller 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
gets the job done 1 
easy to use 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
soggy and not good 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i would recommend this 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
sending it back 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
nice sound 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
excellent service 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
there is no real plot 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
too politically correct 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
gets the job done 1 
the food was very good 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i love this place 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
waitress was good though 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i loved it 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
cumbersome design 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
love this headset 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
never got it 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this is a good joint 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
disappointed 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
owners are really great people 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
left very frustrated 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
its not user friendly 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i consider this theft 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i love it 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
very very sad 0 
great product 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
worst customer service 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
check it out 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
this place is great 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
wont go back 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
great for ipods too 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
very comfortable 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
great product 1 
it was so boring 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i love this device 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
great phone 1 
battery life is also great 1 
total brunch fail 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
1010 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the food is good 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
good food good service 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it was awesome 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
wasted two hours 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
fantastic service here 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the block was amazing 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
battery has no life 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
over rated 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
love this headset 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
defective crap 0 
best headset ever 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
very good quality though 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
magical help 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
very windresistant 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
nothing special 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
sweetest phone 1 
was not happy 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
he was terrible 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
great bluetooth 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
good value great food great service 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
worth every penny 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
very very sad 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
good servicecheck 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the cast was great 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
everything stinks 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
highly recommended a 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this game rocks 1 
very very sad 0 
a standout scene 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
that movie was bad 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
go rent it 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
good works fine 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
stay away from the q 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
great food 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
go and see it 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
nice ambiance 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
brilliant 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
great food 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
so bad 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
overall a delight 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i love it 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
great product for the price 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1

it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1

its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1

being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
works great 1 
it was so boring 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
left very frustrated 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1

i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1

maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
great pizza and salads 1

for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
truly awful 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
no complaints 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
good servicecheck 1 
design flaw 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
not a good bargain 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
again lame 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
sweetest phone 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
what a mistake 0 
really good product 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this is infuriating 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i paid too much 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the best phone in market 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
very good product well made 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
great bluetooth 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
does not fit 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
portable and it works 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
it looks very nice 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the mic is great 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
again lame 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
good item low price 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i consider this theft 0
