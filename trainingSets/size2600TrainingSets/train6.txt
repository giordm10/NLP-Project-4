director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
awful service 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
krussel always good 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
and it was boring 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
overall a delight 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
did not like at all 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
very good though 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it was horrible 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
what a disappointment 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
con spotty service 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
dont waste your money 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
1010 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
you wont regret it 1 
has been working great 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
very bad experience 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i loved it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
great for ipods too 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
not enough volume 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
totally believable 1 
incredible 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the mic is great 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
worthless product 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
go watch it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
mediocre food 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
easy to use 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it is a true classic 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
will order from them again 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i paid too much 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
very bad experience 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i love this thing 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
it was horrible 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
works fine 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i paid too much 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i liked it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
no complaints 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
price is good too 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
not recommended 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
very disappointing 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
its a great item 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
not good for the money 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
better than expected 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the fries were great too 1 
good food good service 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great brunch spot 1 
its pretty easy 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
good prices 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
its really easy 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
good audio quality 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i love this place 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
good price 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
nice ambiance 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this is a great phone 1 
easy to use 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
dont buy it 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
it was packed 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
very easy to use 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the food amazing 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
made very sturdy 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
great price also 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i love this thing 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
great price also 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
worthwhile 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
doesnt work 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
very good product well made 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
disappointed 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
that was nice 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
why was this film made 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
will definitely be back 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
its pretty easy 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it looks very nice 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
excellent short film 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the problem was the script 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
great charger 1 
you wont regret it 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
great brunch spot 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
cumbersome design 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it was so cool 1 
damn good steak 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it was horrendous 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
a bit predictable 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i love this device 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i wont be back 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the management is rude 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
good price 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it is an insane game 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
piece of junk 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
not a good bargain 0 
best headset ever 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
interesting decor 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great service and food 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
its a great item 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this game rocks 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it was a great phone 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
its a great item 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
has been working great 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
disappointed 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
worthwhile 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the mic is great 1 
that was nice 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
1010 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
very windresistant 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
terrible service 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
dont buy it 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
just does not work 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the service was meh 0 
dont miss it 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
works great 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
great product 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i heart this place 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
worked perfectly 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
highly recommended 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
very disappointing 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the design is very good4 1 
great phone 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i want my money back 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
portable and it works 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
so bad 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
excellent product 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it was way over fried 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
poor quality 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
so bad 0 
i love this place 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i loved it 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
very good though 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
go and see it 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
1010 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
this case seems well made 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
poor reliability 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it worked very well 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i think not again 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
omit watching this 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
worst phone ever 0 
good product good seller 1 
great phone 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
we are sending it back 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
just does not work 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
awful service 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
that movie was bad 0 
totally believable 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
disapointing results 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
terrible management 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
poor product 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
very good quality though 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
bad quality 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
never got it 0 
cumbersome design 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
fantastic food 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i heart this place 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
magical help 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
great product for the price 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
not worth it 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
worthless product 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
over rated 0 
service was very prompt 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
sending it back 0 
he was terrible 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
cumbersome design 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
not good for the money 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
bad reception 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the block was amazing 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the food amazing 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
check it out 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
great product 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
they are so cool 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
great phone 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
worthless product 0 
im pleased 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
great phone 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
better than expected 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
these are fabulous 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
service stinks here 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
absolutel junk 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i wont be back 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
great service and food 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
just does not work 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
great product 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
no complaints 1 
the best phone in market 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
id like to return it 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
dont miss it 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the phone loads super 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great for ipods too 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the phone loads super 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
brilliant 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
horrible phone 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
food was really boring 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
you wont regret it 1 
good product good seller 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
great price too 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
wasted two hours 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
how stupid is that 0 
a pretty good product 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
very good though 1 
this pda rocks 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
not enough volume 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
eclectic selection 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
sending it back 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
there is no real plot 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service was very prompt 1 
do not waste your time 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
awsome device works great 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
disappointed 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
worked great 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
kind of flops around 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
go watch it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
poor quality and service 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i paid too much 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
very very fun chef 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
never going back 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this place is good 1 
very disappointing 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
good product incredible value 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
very disappointed 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
its a great item 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
nice leather 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
not worth it 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
works as described 1 
food was average at best 0 
i loved it 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
would not reccommend 0 
defective crap 0 
do not waste your time 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
magical help 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
great price too 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
its very slow 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
warning stay away 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
sending it back 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this phone works great 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the mic is great 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i love this phone 1 
good prices 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
absolutel junk 0 
it was horrendous 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
price is good too 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
fast service 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
good show samsung 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it was horrible 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
it was horrible 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i wont be back 0 
never going back 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the mic is great 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
not worth it 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
very easy to use 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
do not waste your time 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
easy to use 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
that company is a joke 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
awful service 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this place is great 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
not impressed 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
so far so good 1 
so far so good 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
not impressed 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
horrible 0 
bad choice 0 
awesome device 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
bad quality 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the acting was bad 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the cast is good 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
its a great item 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
terrible management 0 
that movie was bad 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the food amazing 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
50 down the drain 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this is infuriating 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
total waste of time 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
great food 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
battery has no life 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
great phone 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
bad purchase 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
what a waste 0 
great product and price 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
but its just not funny 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
left very frustrated 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
wow loved this place 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
great price also 1 
that movie was bad 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
great hands free device 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
not recommended 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
total brunch fail 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
defective crap 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
not worth it 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
no real improvement 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great case and price 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
horrible 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
great phone 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
worked perfectly 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
very bad experience 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
awesome device 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
really awful 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
id love to go back 1 
better than new 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
it was packed 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
very bad experience 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
works fine 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
its a great item 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
will not be back 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i love this device 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
works for me 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
why was this film made 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
delicious 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
we wont be going back 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
go and see it 1 
both great 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1
