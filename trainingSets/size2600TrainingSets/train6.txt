i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
very easy to use 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the mic is great 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
nice design and quality 1 
we wont be returning 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
1010 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
would not reccommend 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
warning do not buy 0 
bad reception 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it is an insane game 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
very disappointed 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
very good though 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
love this headset 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
disappointing 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
excellent performance 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
works for me 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
magical help 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
horrible phone 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it is not good 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
its aggravating 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
love this phone 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
im super pissd 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
its just lame 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
see both films if you can 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
its aggravating 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
happy so far 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
sooooo good 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
we loved the place 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
id like to return it 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
im super pissd 0 
50 down the drain 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
not recommended 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
what a disappointment 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
stay away from the q 0 
interesting decor 1 
go rent it 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
dont buy this product 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
great phone 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the acting sucked 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
con spotty service 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
its a great item 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
food was average at best 0 
food was delicious 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this place has it 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
im pleased 1 
brilliant 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it was packed 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
a great touch 1 
it was horrible 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
1010 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
its just lame 0 
very displeased 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
damn good steak 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
horrible 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
brilliant 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the acting sucked 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
poor construction 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
1010 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
you wont regret it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
portable and it works 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
used and dirty 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
we loved the place 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
great price also 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
a pretty good product 1 
a standout scene 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the food is good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i love this place 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
horrible 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
very disappointing 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
battery is terrible 0 
it works 1 
service sucks 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
how awesome is that 1 
both great 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
interesting decor 1 
no real improvement 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
never going back 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
has been working great 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
mediocre food 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
sweetest phone 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
what a mistake 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
everything stinks 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
great product and price 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
you wont regret it 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
but i dont like it 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
owners are really great people 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
poor quality 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i was mortified 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
service sucks 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
nothing special 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
crust is not good 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
mediocre food 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
1010 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
worthwhile 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
left very frustrated 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
defective crap 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
krussel always good 1 
delicious 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
but i dont like it 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the best phone in market 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
mediocre food 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
great charger 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
again lame 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
better than new 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
im pleased 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
nice sound 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
very good product well made 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
waste of money 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
warning do not buy 0 
bad reception 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
defective crap 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
awful service 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
piece of trash 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
would recommend this item 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
does not fit 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this movie is bad 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
omit watching this 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i will not return 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
good prices 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i would recommend it 1 
no real improvement 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the best phone in market 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
poor quality 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
they are so cool 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
both great 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it was awesome 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
worked perfectly 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
overall a great experience 1 
this is a great deal 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
great phone 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
dont buy this product 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
painful on the ear 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
worst ever 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
too politically correct 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the best phone in market 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great price too 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
con spotty service 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
what a waste of time 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
they have great dinners 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
will definitely be back 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
very easy to use 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it is an insane game 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
interesting decor 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
disappointing 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its just painful 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
great price too 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
will never ever go back 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
a disappointment 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
disappointing 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it was horrible 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
not recommended 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
im pleased 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
id love to go back 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
so just beware 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
a great touch 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
too politically correct 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i love it 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
works great 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
again lame 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
bad reception 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
it was packed 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
easy to use 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
love this phone 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i waited and waited 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
good works fine 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
good item low price 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
cool phone 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
love this headset 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
fast service 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
works fine 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i would recommend it 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
disappointing 0 
that movie was bad 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
very disappointing 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
battery life is real good 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
both great 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
very disappointed 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
great earpiece 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this place is amazing 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
easy to use 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
awful 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
delicious 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
last time buying from you 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
nice leather 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
love this product 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
really ugly 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i am very happy 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
absolutely great 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
not recommended 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
very prompt service 1 
this place is good 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the poor actors 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
great phone 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
dont do it 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
happy so far 1 
no complaints 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
worked great 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
excellent service 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
hated it 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
well never go again 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
but its just not funny 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
very prompt service 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
incredible 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i would recommend this 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
is pretty funny 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
well never go again 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
her role was played well 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
good audio quality 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
bad choice 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
absolutely great 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
very happy with this product 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
dont buy this product 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i loved it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
nice design and quality 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the problem was the script 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
poor quality 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i love this place 1 
never going back 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
its a great item 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i love this place 1 
gets the job done 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the problem was the script 0 
gets the job done 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
cumbersome design 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i was so insulted 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
very disappointing 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
not impressed 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this is infuriating 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
bad reception 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
it was horrendous 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
very disappointed 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
better than expected 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
great product and price 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
interesting decor 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
waitress was good though 1 
love this phone 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
disappointed 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
good product good seller 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
excellent phone 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
im returning them 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
total waste of time 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
total waste of time 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
very good phone 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
love this product 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
nothing new there 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
disappointed 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
really good product 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
very bad experience 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
highly recommended 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the mic is great 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
owners are really great people 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the management is rude 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
painful on the ear 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
her role was played well 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
awsome device works great 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
very disappointed 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
really bad 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
buttons are too small 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
not impressed 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
its pretty easy 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
overall a delight 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
poor sound quality 0 
they have great dinners 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
left very frustrated 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this place is amazing 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it was awesome 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the food was terrible 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the poor actors 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
never got it 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
stay away from the q 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
worst thai ever 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
worthless product 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
easy to use 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
service sucks 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
krussel always good 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
worst martini ever 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
its just painful 0 
it was horrendous 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
crust is not good 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
horrible 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
dont buy this product 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
good works fine 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
crust is not good 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
works for me 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
good audio quality 1 
excellent product 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
good price 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
portable and it works 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
but its just not funny 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
not what i wanted 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
awesome device 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i wont be back 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
disapointing results 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
id love to go back 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
nothing special 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i liked it 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i would recommend this 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
fantastic food 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the block was amazing 1 
her role was played well 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
too politically correct 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
does not fit 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
mediocre food 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
very bad experience 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
awful service 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
waitress was good though 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1

good audio quality 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0

i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i waited and waited 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
yes its that bad 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
we are sending it back 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
very disappointed 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it works 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
they were excellent 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
very windresistant 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
worst ever 0 
not recommended 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
what a waste of time 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
good case 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
nice leather 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
made very sturdy 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
great bluetooth 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
everything was gross 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
total waste of time 0 
highly recommended 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
very easy to use 1 
very good quality though 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
it looks very nice 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it was so funny 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
very good product well made 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
better than expected 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
disappointing experience 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the best phone in market 1 
this is a great little item 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the mic is great 1 
awful 0 
hated it 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this is a great phone 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i think not again 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it was horrible 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the design is very good4 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
that movie was bad 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
piece of trash 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
very prompt service 1 
poor reliability 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0
