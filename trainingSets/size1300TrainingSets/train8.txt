every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
worst phone ever 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i love this thing 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
simply beautiful 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
disappointed 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
will never ever go back 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
love this headset 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
was not happy 0 
works fine 1 
it just blew 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
poor product 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
a great touch 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
worst ever 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this phone works great 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
piece of junk 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this place is amazing 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
service was fantastic 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
great charger 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
warning stay away 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
well never go again 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
an hour seriously 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
it was horrible 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
nice leather 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
great phone 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
last time buying from you 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its pretty easy 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i never come again 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
con spotty service 0 
this phone works great 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
nothing special 0 
crisp and clear 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i love this thing 1 
overall a great experience 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
good audio quality 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
good item low price 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
works well 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
simply beautiful 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
love it great armband 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it looks very nice 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
disappointed 0 
very displeased 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
works great 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
good item low price 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
dont buy this product 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
not good for the money 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
this place is great 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
her role was played well 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i heart this place 1 
will be back again 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
it is shameful 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
love this phone 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
awful service 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
overall a delight 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
wont go back 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
worth every penny 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
dont waste your money 0 
great case and price 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
simply beautiful 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
dont buy it 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
crust is not good 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
poor construction 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
excellent product 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
gets the job done 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the block was amazing 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
very disappointing 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
not what i wanted 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
overall a great experience 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
cumbersome design 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
good case 1 
battery has no life 0 
very bad experience 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
no real improvement 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
good value great food great service 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
great hands free device 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
my order was not correct 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the fries were great too 1 
well never go again 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
con spotty service 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
works great 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
poor product 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
check it out 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
not impressed 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
everything was gross 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
im pleased 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
better than expected 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
dont waste your money 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
how stupid is that 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i wont be back 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
not good for the money 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
a great touch 1 
it was so boring 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
fantastic service here 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
check it out 1 
service was fantastic 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it works 1 
it is shameful 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
excellent service 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it was so funny 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
he was terrible 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
poor construction 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
battery has no life 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
great price too 1 
great food 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
its just lame 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
excellent service 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
does not work 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
easy to use 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
worked perfectly 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
they are so cool 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
will not be back 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
kind of flops around 0 
incredible 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i love this place 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this movie is bad 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it is an insane game 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
worked great 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
a great touch 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
why was this film made 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
works great 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i really liked that 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
brilliant 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
im pleased 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
we wont be going back 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
dont buy it 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i love it 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
good works fine 1 
a standout scene 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
its not user friendly 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the food was terrible 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
great movie 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
a great touch 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
very disappointed 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
they are so cool 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
works great 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
will be back again 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
very good quality though 1 
i was so insulted 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
great price also 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
very poor service 0 
this place has it 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
good value great food great service 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
worked great 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
really bad 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
does not fit 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
not what i wanted 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the fries were great too 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the battery works great 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
very displeased 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
sooooo good 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
service is also cute 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
worthwhile 1 
piece of trash 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
no real improvement 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
defective crap 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
horrible 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1
