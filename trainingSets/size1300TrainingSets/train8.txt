i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
good prices 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i will not return 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
does not fit 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
used and dirty 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
love this phone 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
very good quality though 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
they are so cool 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
kind of flops around 0 
love this phone 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i never come again 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
how stupid is that 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
id like to return it 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
totally believable 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
very disappointed 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
terrible management 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
disappointed 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
poor product 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
its really easy 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
simply beautiful 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
service stinks here 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
its very slow 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
not enough volume 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this place is great 1 
im pleased 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i waited and waited 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
battery is terrible 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
five star plus plus 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
that was funny 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
piece of junk 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
1010 1 
disappointed 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
great audio 1 
worth every penny 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
everything is appalling 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
good audio quality 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
terrible service 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
very very fun chef 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
kind of flops around 0 
worked great 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
sweetest phone 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it was not good 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
good case 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
great product 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
sooooo good 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
you cant beat that 1 
great product and price 1 
love this phone 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
mediocre food 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
item does not match picture 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i love this place 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
good item low price 1 
food was below average 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this is infuriating 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
stay away from the q 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i never come again 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
very friendly staff 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
very disappointing 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
not recommended 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
its very slow 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
you wont regret it 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the poor actors 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
damn good steak 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
again lame 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i love this thing 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
good works fine 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
love this phone 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
better than expected 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
not recommended 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
totally believable 1 
will never ever go back 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
does not fit 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
great price also 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
im not eating here 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
total brunch fail 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
very funny 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great food 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
very good product well made 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
made very sturdy 1 
i heart this place 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this is a great deal 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
battery is terrible 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
amazon sucks 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
again no plot at all 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
krussel always good 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
poor sound quality 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
poor construction 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
good case 1 
damn good steak 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i paid too much 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
everything was gross 0 
soggy and not good 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
brilliant 1 
poor quality and service 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
dont do it 0 
the battery works great 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it was so funny 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
see it 1 
it was so boring 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
very disappointing 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
works for me 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
bad purchase 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
simply beautiful 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the phone loads super 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
never got it 0 
poor construction 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
nice leather 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
well im satisfied 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
im super pissd 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
good item low price 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
we loved the place 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
go rent it 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
it was not good 0 
again no plot at all 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
my order was not correct 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
very friendly staff 1 
omit watching this 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
everything was gross 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
they are so cool 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
we are sending it back 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
poor construction 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
you wont regret it 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
disappointing 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
50 down the drain 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
we wont be going back 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
wont go back 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
worst ever 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
very good product well made 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
will never ever go back 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it was so cool 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
amazon sucks 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
just does not work 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
poor product 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this place is great 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
the design is very good4 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
has been working great 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
im super pissd 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
great product 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
better than youd expect 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this phone works great 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
good audio quality 1 
what a waste of time 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
item does not match picture 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
not easy to watch 0 
not recommended 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
very windresistant 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the best phone in market 1 
great food 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
see it 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
id like to return it 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it just blew 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
great food 1 
love this product 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
not easy to watch 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the film is way too long 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1
