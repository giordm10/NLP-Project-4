i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
warning do not buy 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
very disappointing 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
love this headset 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
dont buy it 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
great phone 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
food was average at best 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
its just lame 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
well never go again 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
poor quality 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
we loved the place 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
crust is not good 0 
that was nice 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
good quality 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
waitress was good though 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
everything was gross 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
not recommended 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it was horrendous 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the food was very good 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
cool phone 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
delicious 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
easy to use 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the fries were great too 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
poor quality 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
fantastic food 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
sooooo good 1 
great hands free device 1 
great charger 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
has been working great 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i want my money back 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
item does not match picture 0 
battery has no life 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
incredible 1 
will definitely be back 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
so just beware 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
design flaw 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
not my thing 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
good works fine 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
magical help 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
but its just not funny 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
it was packed 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
dont waste your money 0 
disappointing 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
its very slow 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
excellent 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
battery life is real good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
it was packed 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
piece of trash 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
bad quality 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
do not waste your time 0 
wont go back 0 
we wont be going back 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this place is good 1 
the food amazing 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
dont buy it 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
great phone 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
again lame 0 
mediocre food 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
dont waste your money 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
used and dirty 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
works well 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
crust is not good 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
item does not match picture 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
youll love it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i am very happy 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
they are so cool 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i never come again 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
good audio quality 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
highly recommended a 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
both great 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
lousy product 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it was not good 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
dont miss it 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i love this place 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the food is good 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
not my thing 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
dont do it 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
highly recommended a 1 
both great 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
dont buy it 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
its a total package 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
absolutely great 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this phone works great 1 
its a total package 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i love this place 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
kind of flops around 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
dont do it 0 
well never go again 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i never come again 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
we loved the place 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the design is very good4 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the food was very good 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i love this thing 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
very good though 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
good product incredible value 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
good works fine 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i am very happy 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
good food good service 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
it looks very nice 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the cast is good 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
delicious 1 
awesome service and food 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its a great item 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
low quality 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
low quality 0 
good works fine 1 
poor product 0 
the crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
1010 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
soggy and not good 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
works great 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
price is good too 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
not worth it 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
wasted two hours 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
very disappointing 0 
poor quality 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
awesome service and food 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
good product incredible value 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
awful service 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
lousy product 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it works 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
give this one a look 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
love it great armband 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
works great 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
gets the job done 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
amazon sucks 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it was awesome 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
over rated 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
50 down the drain 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
it works 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
not my thing 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
love this product 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
not recommended 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
great product and price 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
damn good steak 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
very funny 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
great movie 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
battery life is real good 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the food was very good 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
happy so far 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
horrible phone 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
not good for the money 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the food amazing 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
great phone 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
not my thing 0 
mediocre food 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
did not like at all 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i love this place 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
sooooo good 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
this is a great deal 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
worst customer service 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
crust is not good 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
im not eating here 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this pda rocks 1
