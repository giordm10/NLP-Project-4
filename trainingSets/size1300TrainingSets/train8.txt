same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this phone works great 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
it looks very nice 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this phone works great 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
battery is terrible 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
dont buy it 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
good price 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
awesome device 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
total brunch fail 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
bad purchase 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the fries were great too 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
go watch it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i love this place 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
he was terrible 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
no real improvement 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
great sound and service 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
love this product 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
poor sound quality 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
great earpiece 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
not a good bargain 0 
im returning them 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
worthless product 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it was not good 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i think not again 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
im not eating here 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
very displeased 0 
it was so cool 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
awful service 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
good case excellent value 1 
worst customer service 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
terrible service 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
excellent performance 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
worked perfectly 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
lousy product 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
awsome device works great 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
what a mistake 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
poor quality 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
worked great 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
great audio 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i would recommend it 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
works great 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
we are sending it back 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
just does not work 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
it was awesome 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
piece of junk 0 
not recommended 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
a bit predictable 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
do not waste your time 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
will not be back 0 
too politically correct 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
very good product well made 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
really good product 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
magical help 1 
totally believable 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
love this phone 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
great phone 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
great hands free device 1 
i paid too much 0 
food was average at best 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the cast was great 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
excellent service 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
krussel always good 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i love this phone 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
great for ipods too 1 
very disappointing 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
just what i wanted 1 
love it great armband 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it was awesome 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
highly recommended 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i consider this theft 0 
great case and price 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
not what i wanted 0 
it was so cool 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
piece of junk 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
again lame 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
everything is appalling 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
sweetest phone 1 
i loved it 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
worked perfectly 1 
nice sound 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
disappointing 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
wow loved this place 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
very good quality though 1 
the food amazing 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
excellent service 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
will be back again 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
works great 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
low quality 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
it was horrendous 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
not impressed 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
awful service 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
kind of flops around 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the poor actors 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i am very happy 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
not impressed 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
poor sound quality 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
so they performed 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
sending it back 0 
horrible 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
there is no real plot 0 
good servicecheck 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
damn good steak 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
an hour seriously 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this place is good 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
good item low price 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
lousy product 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
love this phone 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
food was delicious 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
works great 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
price is good too 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this is a great deal 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
this case seems well made 1 
not a good bargain 0 
never got it 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is a great phone 1 
wont go back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
food was average at best 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
works for me 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
really bad 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
amazon sucks 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
poor construction 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
very disappointed 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the food was terrible 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
interesting decor 1 
worst martini ever 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great service and food 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
works for me 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
very bad experience 0 
eclectic selection 1 
im pleased 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
service sucks 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
great service and food 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
nice ambiance 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
great product 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i love this phone 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
very displeased 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
excellent service 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
youll love it 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
con spotty service 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it is shameful 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
design flaw 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
its a total package 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it was horrible 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i liked it 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
excellent performance 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i love this place 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
absolutely great 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
terrible management 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
very bad experience 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
would recommend this item 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
very disappointing 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i consider this theft 0 
great audio 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
what a waste 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
battery is terrible 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i heart this place 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
so bad 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i paid too much 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
go and see it 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
sooooo good 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i really liked that 1 
good food good service 1 
i really liked that 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the problem was the script 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
disapointing results 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
nice leather 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
krussel always good 1 
why was this film made 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
great product for the price 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
poor quality 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
a great touch 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
very windresistant 1
