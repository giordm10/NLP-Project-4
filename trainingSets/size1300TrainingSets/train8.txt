great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
awesome device 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
good value great food great service 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this place is good 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
no real improvement 0 
dont buy it 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
well never go again 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
nice leather 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i love it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
great phone 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
not good for the money 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
warning do not buy 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
id love to go back 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
there is no real plot 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
great price also 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the portion was huge 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
really bad 0 
this is a good joint 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
1010 1 
doesnt work 0 
i love this thing 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
horrible phone 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
piece of junk 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the cast is good 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the poor actors 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
would not reccommend 0 
works for me 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
good item low price 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
there is no real plot 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i would recommend this 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i love this place 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
piece of junk 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
very good phone 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
love this product 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
they were excellent 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
its really easy 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
damn good steak 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
last time buying from you 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
love this phone 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
see both films if you can 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
good servicecheck 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
nice design and quality 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
will order from them again 1 
great product and price 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
great phone 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
really bad 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it was way over fried 0 
never going back 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i consider this theft 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
very comfortable 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this is a great deal 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
great choice 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i wont be back 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
price is good too 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
great charger 1 
good food good service 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
great bluetooth 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is a great little item 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
its just painful 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
this is a great deal 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i really liked that 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
check it out 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
great audio 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it was delicious 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
battery life is also great 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
works fine 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
has been working great 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
we loved the place 1 
does not fit 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
id like to return it 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
good quality 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
well never go again 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
good works fine 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
dont go here 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i was so insulted 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
so they performed 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
love this phone 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
very funny 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this is infuriating 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
good item low price 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
they have great dinners 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
he was terrible 0 
works great 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
its very slow 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
very poor service 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
battery life is also great 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
you wont regret it 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i love it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
nothing special 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
will not be back 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
it was awesome 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
my order was not correct 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
dont do it 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
will be back again 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
great product for the price 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
piece of trash 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
so just beware 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
it works 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the acting was bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
fantastic food 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
its really easy 1 
warning stay away 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
portable and it works 1 
poor construction 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
will order from them again 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
very disappointing 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
happy so far 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
these are fabulous 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
disappointing 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
worthwhile 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
how awful she is 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
never going back 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
id like to return it 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
piece of junk 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
a good time 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
defective crap 0

i rate this movie 910 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
awful service 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
does not work 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
how awful she is 0 
works fine 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i wont be back 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
great movie 1 
its a piece of crap 0

this one is simply a disappointment 0 
great movie 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
truly awful 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
great product and price 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
bad reception 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
highly recommended a 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
everything is appalling 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the service was meh 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
highly recommended 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
sending it back 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
warning stay away 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
nice ambiance 1 
worst martini ever 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
awesome device 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
poor sound quality 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
interesting decor 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
you cant beat that 1 
nice leather 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
check it out 1 
piece of trash 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i really liked that 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i waited and waited 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
great price also 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
krussel always good 1 
incredible 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the best phone in market 1 
awesome service and food 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this place has it 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
good product incredible value 1 
it was way over fried 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i was mortified 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
they were excellent 1 
again no plot at all 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
crisp and clear 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
never going back 0 
very poor service 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the poor actors 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
im super pissd 0
