and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
works great 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
id like to return it 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
does not fit 0 
this place is good 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
very happy with this product 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
go rent it 1 
totally believable 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
left very frustrated 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
again no plot at all 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i love this thing 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the fries were great too 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
great phone 1 
they are so cool 1 
terrible management 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
wow loved this place 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great phone 1 
not good for the money 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
best headset ever 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i heart this place 1 
its not user friendly 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
very good phone 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
so far so good 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
battery life is real good 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
best headset ever 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
buttons are too small 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
that company is a joke 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
awsome device works great 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
terrible management 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the cast is good 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
dont buy it 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i wont be back 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
very disappointed 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
wow loved this place 1 
damn good steak 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
piece of trash 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
waste of money 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this place is great 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
battery has no life 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it was so cool 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
no complaints 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the design is very good4 1 
excellent 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
very disappointing 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
im super pissd 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
worst martini ever 0 
hated it 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the food was very good 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
used and dirty 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
this is a great deal 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
worst ever 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
awesome service and food 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i heart this place 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this phone works great 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
well never go again 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
great charger 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
very good phone 1 
the best phone in market 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the acting sucked 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
bad reception 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
very good phone 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
how stupid is that 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
see it 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
nice design and quality 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
hated it 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
works great 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
great product 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
incredible 1 
totally believable 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
great price also 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
its aggravating 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
design flaw 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
doesnt work 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
it was packed 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
great phone 1 
the problem was the script 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
either way it sucks 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
does not fit 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
owners are really great people 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
fast service 1 
portable and it works 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
that was nice 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
doesnt work 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
how stupid is that 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
will definitely be back 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
horrible phone 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
not recommended 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
go rent it 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this phone works great 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
bad reception 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
dont do it 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
worth every penny 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i love this phone 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
better than new 1 
we wont be returning 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
doesnt last long 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the fries were great too 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
horrible 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
50 down the drain 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
worst ever 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
it was a great phone 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
nothing special 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
will be back again 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
dont buy it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
a great touch 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i never come again 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
will order from them again 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
its really easy 1 
great product 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
its a total package 1 
hated it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it was packed 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
its really easy 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i wont be back 0 
the mic is great 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
what a mistake 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
five star plus plus 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
very good product well made 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
warning stay away 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
terrible management 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
im not eating here 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
dont do it 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
why was this film made 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
youll love it 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
great for ipods too 1 
highly recommended 1 
so far so good 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i waited and waited 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
disapointing results 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
sweetest phone 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i waited and waited 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
soggy and not good 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
crust is not good 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
works well 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
how stupid is that 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
worst thai ever 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
interesting decor 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
great phone 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
im pleased 1 
not recommended 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
excellent phone 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the food was terrible 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
these are fabulous 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the food was terrible 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
very windresistant 1 
both great 1 
absolutely great 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this place is good 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i heart this place 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
low quality 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
its just painful 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
everything is appalling 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
not enough volume 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
very disappointing 0 
better than new 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
works great 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
go watch it 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
easy to use 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
great price too 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i love this thing 1 
very bad experience 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is a great little item 1 
it was delicious 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
dont go here 0 
it was so cool 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the portion was huge 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
great product 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
id like to return it 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
used and dirty 0 
service is also cute 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
bad choice 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
again no plot at all 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
no real improvement 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
does not fit 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
really awful 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
poor quality 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
love this product 1 
food was really boring 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i love this phone 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great movie 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
very very sad 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
we wont be returning 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
very bad experience 0 
better than new 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1
