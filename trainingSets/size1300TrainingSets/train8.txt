this is a great place to eat 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
fantastic service here 1 
very good product well made 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
wow loved this place 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
interesting decor 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
made very sturdy 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
easy to use 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
love this product 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
well never go again 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
disappointing experience 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
works good 1 
stay away from the q 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this place is amazing 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it was so funny 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
nice design and quality 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
used and dirty 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
everything stinks 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the acting was bad 0 
doesnt work 0 
bad reception 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
it is not good 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
nice ambiance 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
awful service 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
brilliant 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
it was so boring 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
dont buy it 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
very good phone 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
dont buy this product 0 
left very frustrated 0 
excellent phone 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the food was terrible 0 
not my thing 0 
i consider this theft 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
great hands free device 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it was horrible 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
does not work 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
bad reception 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
great product 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this phone works great 1 
great audio 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
great charger 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
so far so good 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
worthless product 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
overall a delight 1 
i was mortified 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
1010 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
buttons are too small 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
really bad 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
item does not match picture 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
crisp and clear 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
has been working great 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this place is great 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
awesome service and food 1 
disappointed 0 
works good 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
warning stay away 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
dont go here 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
has been working great 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
excellent service 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
youll love it 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
great phone 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
nothing special 0 
the block was amazing 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
no real improvement 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
no real improvement 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
just does not work 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
they are so cool 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
very very fun chef 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
will order from them again 1 
it was so funny 1 
the best phone in market 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i waited and waited 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great product and price 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
both great 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
service was very prompt 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
im not eating here 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
great audio 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
so just beware 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
youll love it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
stay away from the q 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
wow loved this place 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
too politically correct 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
go rent it 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this place is great 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
defective crap 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
everything stinks 0 
buttons are too small 0 
great case and price 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i paid too much 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
very friendly staff 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
that company is a joke 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it works 1 
good works fine 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
not worth it 0 
i never come again 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
magical help 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i heart this place 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
very easy to use 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the cast is good 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
that was nice 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
last time buying from you 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
design flaw 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
not my thing 0 
great product for the price 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
im returning them 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
what a waste 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
not enough volume 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
both great 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
horrible phone 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
there is no real plot 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great product 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
best headset ever 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the cast is good 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
great phone 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
a standout scene 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
waitress was good though 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
doesnt work 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0

also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
really awful 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1

i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
very funny 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
fantastic food 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
nice leather 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
damn good steak 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the best phone in market 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
check it out 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
that was funny 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
so bad 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
its a total package 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
truly awful 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i want my money back 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
doesnt work 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i paid too much 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
that was funny 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
will definitely be back 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i was so insulted 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the cast is good 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the management is rude 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
very disappointed 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
krussel always good 1 
it is not good 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
highly recommended a 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
waste of money 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
warning stay away 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
will order from them again 1 
love this phone 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
is pretty funny 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i am very happy 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
very easy to use 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
defective crap 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
great movie 1 
i want my money back 0 
i paid too much 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
worst customer service 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
not easy to watch 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
absolutel junk 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
food was below average 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0
