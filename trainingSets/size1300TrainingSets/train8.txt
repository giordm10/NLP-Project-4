i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
it was equally awful 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
so they performed 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
does not work 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
excellent service 1 
does not work 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
very prompt service 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
love this headset 1 
very disappointed 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
food was really boring 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
well never go again 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
so bad 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
awsome device works great 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
great case and price 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
disappointed 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
wasted two hours 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
works great 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
very good phone 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
this is a great deal 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
go rent it 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
you wont regret it 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
kind of flops around 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
works for me 1 
we wont be going back 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
would not go back 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
kind of flops around 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
my order was not correct 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
very comfortable 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
works great 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
good works fine 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the best phone in market 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
very funny 1 
fast service 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
very windresistant 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
you wont regret it 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
dont buy it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
better than expected 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i was mortified 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
price is good too 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
a disappointment 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this is a good joint 1 
works great 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i think not again 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
great phone 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
this phone works great 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
kind of flops around 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i was mortified 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
interesting decor 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
delicious 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
why was this film made 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
disappointed 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
very good product well made 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
works fine 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
does not fit 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it was delicious 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
it worked very well 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
does not fit 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
wow loved this place 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
its a total package 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
worthless product 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
poor construction 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i loved it 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
yes its that bad 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
will never ever go back 0 
works for me 1 
it worked very well 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the food was terrible 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
service was fantastic 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
it was equally awful 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
krussel always good 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this is a good joint 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i love this place 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
defective crap 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
very disappointed 0 
a standout scene 1 
would not go back 0 
worked great 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
lousy product 0 
so far so good 1 
warning stay away 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
bad quality 0 
total waste of time 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
service was fantastic 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
total waste of time 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
would not go back 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
really good product 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
it was a great phone 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
lousy product 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
gets the job done 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
we loved the place 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
he was terrible 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it works 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
absolutely great 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
worst customer service 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the food was terrible 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
im pleased 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
has been working great 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
works great 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
very good quality though 1 
nothing new there 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i was mortified 0 
i love this thing 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
excellent service 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it was equally awful 0 
what a waste 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
you cant beat that 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
we are sending it back 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
will never ever go back 0 
highly recommended 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
very very sad 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it is not good 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
service is also cute 1 
does not work 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
but i dont like it 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
works great 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it was awesome 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
painful on the ear 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
dont miss it 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
bad quality 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
works for me 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
good product good seller 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the food was very good 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
both great 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
works for me 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
they have great dinners 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it was horrendous 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it was so boring 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i consider this theft 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
see both films if you can 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
dont waste your money 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
a good time 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
great earpiece 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
con spotty service 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
again lame 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
bad choice 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
good works fine 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
very disappointing 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i love this place 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
piece of trash 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
great product 1 
i love this thing 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
would recommend this item 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
great phone 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i waited and waited 0 
over rated 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
this is a great deal 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the fries were great too 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
would not go back 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
they are so cool 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
would recommend this item 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
interesting decor 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it was awesome 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
food was delicious 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
does not fit 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the portion was huge 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
a great touch 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
awesome device 1 
bad choice 0 
too politically correct 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the best phone in market 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
low quality 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
does not fit 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
works good 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
excellent 1 
the mic is great 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it was horrendous 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
good case excellent value 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the cast was great 1 
doesnt work 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0
