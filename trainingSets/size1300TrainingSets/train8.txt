who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
nothing special 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
works great 1 
the management is rude 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
used and dirty 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the design is very good4 1 
has been working great 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i was so insulted 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this place has it 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
give this one a look 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
fantastic service here 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
why was this film made 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
they were excellent 1 
both great 1 
total waste of time 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
an hour seriously 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
simply beautiful 1 
con spotty service 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the acting was bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
good food good service 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
painful on the ear 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
everything stinks 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
good prices 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
highly recommended a 1 
both great 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
crisp and clear 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
so bad 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the cast is good 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
very friendly staff 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
will definitely be back 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i am very happy 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
great for ipods too 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
stay away from the q 0 
great movie 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
nothing new there 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
very funny 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it just blew 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
would not reccommend 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
fast service 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this is a great deal 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
id love to go back 1 
owners are really great people 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
good food good service 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
very prompt service 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the best phone in market 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
buttons are too small 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
50 down the drain 0 
not a good bargain 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the acting sucked 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i wont be back 0 
so they performed 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
works great 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
doesnt work 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
you cant beat that 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it worked very well 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
great phone 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
im pleased 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
so they performed 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
what a waste of time 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
worst customer service 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
disappointing 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this is a great little item 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this place is amazing 1 
great earpiece 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
very good though 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
a good time 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
awesome device 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
works great 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
will order from them again 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
item does not match picture 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
there is no real plot 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
really good product 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
never going back 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
not a good bargain 0 
yes its that bad 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
its really easy 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it was way over fried 0 
does not fit 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
we loved the place 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
works great 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
just what i wanted 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
excellent phone 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i heart this place 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
krussel always good 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
bad reception 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
so just beware 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
really good product 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
very very sad 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
really ugly 0 
food was average at best 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i heart this place 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
go and see it 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
great value 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i want my money back 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the food amazing 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
not recommended 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
very bad experience 0 
warning do not buy 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it was equally awful 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
so far so good 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
great audio 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
great product and price 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it was way over fried 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
terrible management 0 
good audio quality 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
very comfortable 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
1010 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
very disappointing 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this pda rocks 1 
horrible 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
they were excellent 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
an hour seriously 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
how awful she is 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
very good quality though 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i was mortified 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
lousy product 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it is an insane game 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
id like to return it 0 
really good product 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
great phone 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
disappointed 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
works fine 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i love this place 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
buttons are too small 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i love this device 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the phone loads super 1 
doesnt work 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
he was terrible 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i think not again 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
piece of trash 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the battery works great 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
it worked very well 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i love this place 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
very disappointing 0 
not enough volume 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the best phone in market 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this is a good joint 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
great value 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
not recommended 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
would not reccommend 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
great choice 1 
not easy to watch 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
great price too 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
food was delicious 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the film is way too long 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i was mortified 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
good value great food great service 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
go and see it 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
so far so good 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
worst martini ever 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
love this product 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
both great 1 
not my thing 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
why was this film made 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
again no plot at all 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
would recommend this item 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
incredible 1 
great phone 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
its very slow 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
happy so far 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
brilliant 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
very disappointing 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
omit watching this 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
good prices 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
do not waste your time 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
its a great item 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1
