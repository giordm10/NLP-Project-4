too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i loved it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i never come again 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
works fine 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
so bad 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
good value great food great service 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
service was very prompt 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
it was delicious 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
battery has no life 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
extremely tasty 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
id love to go back 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the film is way too long 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the food amazing 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
con spotty service 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
price is good too 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i am very happy 1 
check it out 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
that company is a joke 0 
does not work 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
so they performed 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
will not be back 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
wont go back 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is infuriating 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
better than new 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
her role was played well 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
my order was not correct 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
not worth it 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i love this place 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
great phone 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
disappointed 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i loved it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
very good though 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
service was very prompt 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
very easy to use 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
too politically correct 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the battery works great 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
its very slow 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
give this one a look 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
love this headset 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great phone 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the cast is good 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
how stupid is that 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
im pleased 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
great price also 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
great earpiece 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
her role was played well 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
he was terrible 0 
excellent product 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i liked it 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i love this place 1 
dont buy this product 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
low quality 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
not recommended 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
so they performed 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
great phone 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
works for me 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
excellent short film 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
it was delicious 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this place is amazing 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the film is way too long 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
go and see it 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
will not be back 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
damn good steak 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
awsome device works great 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
good show samsung 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
terrible service 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
sending it back 0 
great audio 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
no complaints 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
again lame 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
its just painful 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
easy to use 1 
fantastic food 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
worked perfectly 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
very very fun chef 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
how awful she is 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
yes its that bad 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
very disappointing 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
we wont be returning 0 
very disappointed 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
dont go here 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i think not again 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
good show samsung 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this place is great 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
waste of money 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
good works fine 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
stay away from the q 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
so they performed 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
total waste of time 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
a standout scene 1 
has been working great 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i heart this place 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
terrible service 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i will not return 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the acting was bad 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
good case 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
food was delicious 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
worthwhile 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
great audio 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
great earpiece 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
good value great food great service 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
was not happy 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
made very sturdy 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i was mortified 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
great phone 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
check it out 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
very displeased 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
really bad 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the fries were great too 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i liked it 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
great hands free device 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
better than youd expect 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
portable and it works 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
dont buy this product 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
disappointing 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
awesome device 1 
it worked very well 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
that movie was bad 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
worth every penny 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
disappointing 0 
very good though 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i never come again 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this place is amazing 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
not enough volume 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
really bad 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
mediocre food 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
great service and food 1 
that was nice 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
warning stay away 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
everything was gross 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
wasted two hours 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
horrible phone 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
total brunch fail 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
worked perfectly 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it was equally awful 0 
very poor service 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
hated it 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
its just painful 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
it just blew 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
eclectic selection 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
made very sturdy 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
low quality 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
awesome device 1 
its really easy 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this place is good 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
its aggravating 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
dont buy it 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
worst ever 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
wont go back 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this place is great 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it is an insane game 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
im super pissd 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
very good quality though 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
we loved the place 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the battery works great 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
doesnt work 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
has been working great 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
terrible management 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
its aggravating 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
poor product 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
both great 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1
