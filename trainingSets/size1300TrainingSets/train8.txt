this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
very good quality though 1 
love it great armband 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
excellent phone 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
nice leather 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this place is good 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
very prompt service 1 
its aggravating 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
im pleased 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
a great touch 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
very bad experience 0 
hated it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
stay away from the q 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
its a great item 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
very comfortable 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
eclectic selection 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
a bit predictable 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the portion was huge 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
a good time 1 
so far so good 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this place lacked style 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
would not reccommend 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
good transmit audio 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
will never ever go back 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
very comfortable 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
very comfortable 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
dont buy this product 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
does not work 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
very poor service 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
better than youd expect 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
great food 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the food is good 1 
over rated 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
very disappointing 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
works fine 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
what a mistake 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it works 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
1010 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
damn good steak 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
just does not work 0 
low quality 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
he was terrible 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
this game rocks 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
great hands free device 1 
why was this film made 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
they are so cool 1 
worked great 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
really ugly 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
very disappointed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
very easy to use 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
great phone 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
fast service 1 
it is a true classic 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
really ugly 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
very disappointing 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
its a great item 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
food was delicious 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
its not user friendly 0 
i waited and waited 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
how stupid is that 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
great audio 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this movie is bad 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
good food good service 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
easy to use 1 
easy to use 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
but its just not funny 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
it works 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i love this thing 1 
disappointing 0 
would not go back 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
highly recommended 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
very very fun chef 1 
i am very happy 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
does not fit 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
works for me 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i want my money back 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
worst thai ever 0 
worth every penny 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
worthwhile 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this is a great phone 1 
low quality 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
im super pissd 0 
very prompt service 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this place is amazing 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
how awful she is 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
never got it 0 
the management is rude 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this game rocks 1 
happy so far 1 
great product and price 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
used and dirty 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
works great 1 
simply beautiful 1 
poor reliability 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
how stupid is that 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the cast is good 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the fries were great too 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
this place is great 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
food was delicious 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
works for me 1 
very disappointing 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
it was horrible 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
we wont be going back 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
not enough volume 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
great for ipods too 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
very friendly staff 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
terrible management 0 
love this phone 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
mediocre food 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
food was delicious 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
good show samsung 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great hands free device 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
very prompt service 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a great touch 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
very disappointing 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
would not go back 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
sooooo good 1 
great price too 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
how stupid is that 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
you wont regret it 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
not what i wanted 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
what a mistake 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
disappointed 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
disappointing 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
its aggravating 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
its not user friendly 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
very poor service 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
great food 1 
will definitely be back 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
great service and food 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
extremely tasty 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it is an insane game 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
really good product 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
worthless product 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
poor sound quality 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
its a great item 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
excellent product 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
really bad 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
total brunch fail 0 
good price 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
battery life is also great 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
they have great dinners 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
warning stay away 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not worth it 0 
give this one a look 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
either way it sucks 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
its very slow 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
was not happy 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
good product good seller 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
very funny 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
great sound and service 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
it works 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
excellent phone 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
battery life is also great 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
good case excellent value 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
cool phone 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
we loved the place 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it works 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1
