damn good steak 1 
that company is a joke 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
incredible 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
great charger 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
highly recommended 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
excellent phone 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
yes its that bad 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
kind of flops around 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
its really easy 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great product and price 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the acting sucked 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
last time buying from you 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
not impressed 0 
just does not work 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the acting sucked 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
good food good service 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
im returning them 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
works well 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
worthless product 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
poor product 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
item does not match picture 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the food amazing 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
excellent short film 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
battery has no life 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
truly awful 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i love it 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
dont waste your money 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
this pda rocks 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the fries were great too 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i paid too much 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
how awful she is 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
made very sturdy 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
not my thing 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
excellent phone 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
great audio 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
owners are really great people 1 
works great 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
love this phone 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
sweetest phone 1 
owners are really great people 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
her role was played well 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
battery is terrible 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i love this device 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
good works fine 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
sending it back 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
it was a great phone 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
fantastic food 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
works fine 1 
well never go again 0 
terrible service 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its a great item 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i will not return 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
service is also cute 1 
i wont be back 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
great product 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
youll love it 1 
krussel always good 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
great phone 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
great hands free device 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
doesnt last long 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
terrible management 0 
it was delicious 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
very friendly staff 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
con spotty service 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
nothing new there 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
service was fantastic 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
nothing new there 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
good item low price 1 
very friendly staff 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
how awful she is 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i consider this theft 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
crisp and clear 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this phone works great 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
love this headset 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
did not like at all 0 
waste of money 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
its a great item 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
not enough volume 0 
this place is great 1 
great phone 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
worst ever 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
its just painful 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
sending it back 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the cast was great 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
awful service 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
buttons are too small 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
piece of trash 0 
good servicecheck 1 
worthless product 0 
the acting sucked 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
worst thai ever 0 
overall a delight 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
that movie was bad 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
horrible phone 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
would not reccommend 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
terrible service 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i was mortified 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
great sound and service 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
no complaints 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this phone works great 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i consider this theft 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
dont waste your time 0 
so far so good 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it works 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
service stinks here 0 
just does not work 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it works 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
this movie is bad 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
a good time 1 
great phone 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
food was delicious 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
great charger 1 
it works 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
this place is great 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
give this one a look 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
this is infuriating 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it was packed 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
will order from them again 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the cast was great 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
her role was played well 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
good prices 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
this is infuriating 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
will not be back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
so bad 0 
battery is terrible 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
great for ipods too 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i was so insulted 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it looks very nice 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
piece of trash 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
really good product 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
not impressed 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i am very happy 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
terrible management 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
give this one a look 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
you cant beat that 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
how awful she is 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
poor product 0 
disapointing results 0 
buttons are too small 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
great movie 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
overall a great experience 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
doesnt last long 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
how awesome is that 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
very disappointing 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
50 down the drain 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
lousy product 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
great sound and service 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
overall a delight 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
low quality 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
excellent product 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
portable and it works 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
will not be back 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
will never ever go back 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
love this headset 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
great case and price 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
poor construction 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
total waste of time 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i love this place 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
works great 1 
this is infuriating 0 
design flaw 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the film is way too long 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
sooooo good 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0
