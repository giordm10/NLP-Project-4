on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
an hour seriously 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it looks very nice 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
dont waste your money 0 
they were excellent 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
doesnt work 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
no complaints 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
defective crap 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
cumbersome design 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
battery has no life 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
overall a delight 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
excellent service 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
disappointing experience 0 
very disappointing 0 
well never go again 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
give this one a look 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
check it out 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
1010 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
a disappointment 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
awesome device 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
well never go again 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
good value great food great service 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
crust is not good 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
a disappointment 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this movie is bad 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
great phone 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
works as described 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
did not like at all 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
how stupid is that 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this phone works great 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
works as described 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
disappointing experience 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this is a great deal 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
nice leather 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
so bad 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
delicious 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
what a disappointment 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i waited and waited 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
works fine 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
better than new 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the phone loads super 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i heart this place 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
its very slow 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
go watch it 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
krussel always good 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
highly recommended 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
over rated 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this place is good 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i will not return 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
better than expected 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
food was really boring 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
food was delicious 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
disapointing results 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
love this phone 1 
great product for the price 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
great phone 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
food was delicious 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
this game rocks 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont buy this product 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this case seems well made 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great audio 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
dont waste your money 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
an hour seriously 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it is not good 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i liked it 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
terrible management 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
piece of trash 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
what a waste 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
bad quality 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i love this thing 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
great food 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
we wont be returning 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the food amazing 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
check it out 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great product and price 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
again lame 0 
delicious 1 
we wont be returning 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
over rated 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
id love to go back 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
design flaw 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
it was not good 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
worst ever 0 
a disappointment 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
absolutel junk 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the design is very good4 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
love this headset 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
interesting decor 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
left very frustrated 0 
not good for the money 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
eclectic selection 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
never going back 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
see it 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i love this phone 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
warning stay away 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
you wont regret it 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
see it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
sooooo good 1 
what a disappointment 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i will not return 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
battery is terrible 0 
nothing special 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
cool phone 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i love this phone 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
you cant beat that 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
disappointed 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this movie is bad 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
dont buy it 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
not recommended 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
works great 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
great sound and service 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i loved it 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the phone loads super 1 
nothing special 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
these are fabulous 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
service is also cute 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
its very slow 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
cool phone 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i paid too much 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i love this phone 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
not recommended 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
that movie was bad 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
excellent phone 1 
very disappointing 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
it looks very nice 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
id love to go back 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
not worth it 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
good case 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very disappointed 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
they were excellent 1 
good show samsung 1 
low quality 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
youll love it 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great product 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
again lame 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
disappointing 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
worst martini ever 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
worst ever 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
very disappointed 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the service was meh 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
really awful 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
easy to use 1 
this is infuriating 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
it was not good 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
service was very prompt 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i love it 1 
not recommended 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
great product 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
not what i wanted 0 
excellent service 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
1010 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
good value great food great service 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
does not fit 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
not good for the money 0 
and it was boring 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0
