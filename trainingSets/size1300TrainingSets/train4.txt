i have recommended it to friends 1 
incredible 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
worst customer service 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
happy so far 1 
the food was very good 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
give this one a look 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
very displeased 0 
works great 1 
check it out 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
buttons are too small 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
works fine 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the food was very good 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i want my money back 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the portion was huge 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
good product good seller 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
well never go again 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
go and see it 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
wasted two hours 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the cast is good 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
service sucks 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
waste of money 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
why was this film made 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
never got it 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
im super pissd 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
horrible phone 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
does not fit 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
great phone 1 
this is a great little item 1 
will order from them again 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
nice sound 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
id like to return it 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
go rent it 1 
the battery works great 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it works 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this movie is bad 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
very good though 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the poor actors 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
it is not good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
nice leather 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the management is rude 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
very disappointed 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
absolutel junk 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
service is also cute 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
very windresistant 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
not worth it 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this is infuriating 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i love it 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i never come again 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
great product and price 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
this phone works great 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the problem was the script 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
well never go again 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
happy so far 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i love it 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
bad choice 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
it is shameful 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
so bad 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
dont do it 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i wont be back 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i would recommend this 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the film is way too long 0 
poor construction 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
worst ever 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
so they performed 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it was not good 0 
the phone loads super 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
waitress was good though 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
fantastic service here 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i love this place 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
price is good too 1 
cool phone 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
works fine 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i am very happy 1 
good product good seller 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
this place is great 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
service was fantastic 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
omit watching this 0 
the cast is good 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
im super pissd 0 
what a waste 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
really awful 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
so they performed 1 
give this one a look 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
but i dont like it 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
soggy and not good 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i never come again 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
works great 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
you wont regret it 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the portion was huge 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the cast was great 1 
it was so boring 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
really bad 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
very very sad 0 
go and see it 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
very disappointed 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
doesnt work 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
not what i wanted 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
worked great 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
really bad 0 
i love it 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
over rated 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
mediocre food 0 
im not eating here 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
dont do it 0 
we wont be returning 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this is a great little item 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the cast was great 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
truly awful 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
not impressed 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
overall a great experience 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
its really easy 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the food was very good 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
magical help 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
incredible 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
worst customer service 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
works good 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
they are so cool 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
worthless product 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i consider this theft 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
damn good steak 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
so they performed 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
good prices 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
con spotty service 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
good prices 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
fast service 1 
a good time 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
very disappointing 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
works as described 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the film is way too long 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this pda rocks 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
does not fit 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this is a good joint 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
was not happy 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
nice ambiance 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
not easy to watch 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
works great 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
good prices 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
over rated 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the food was terrible 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
does not fit 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this place is amazing 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
no real improvement 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
will be back again 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
you wont regret it 1 
awful service 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it was packed 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
its very slow 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
battery is terrible 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
dont do it 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
low quality 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1
