one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
great phone 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
five star plus plus 1 
great price too 1 
over rated 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
design flaw 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
crust is not good 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it was so funny 1 
the food is good 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
portable and it works 1 
i heart this place 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
not worth it 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
love it great armband 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
food was average at best 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
fantastic service here 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
great phone 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
great case and price 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
very disappointed 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
very disappointing 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
it was a great phone 1 
over rated 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
again no plot at all 0 
this is a great little item 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it was so cool 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
omit watching this 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
its really easy 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
works well 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
great brunch spot 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
awesome device 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
awsome device works great 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
works well 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
best headset ever 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
youll love it 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
never got it 0 
this place is great 1 
simply beautiful 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
con spotty service 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
works great 1 
will order from them again 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
a good time 1 
dont buy this product 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
doesnt work 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i never come again 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great charger 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this case seems well made 1 
we loved the place 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
waste of money 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
gets the job done 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i love this place 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
my order was not correct 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
a great touch 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
disappointing 0 
dont buy it 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
works as described 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
low quality 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
bad reception 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i really liked that 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
very displeased 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
a disappointment 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
love this headset 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
its a great item 1 
its very slow 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the fries were great too 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
interesting decor 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the phone loads super 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
a disappointment 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
would not reccommend 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
does not work 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the problem was the script 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
this place is great 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
love this product 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
a bit predictable 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i never come again 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this case seems well made 1 
great phone 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
nothing new there 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
worthless product 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
not a good bargain 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
warning stay away 0 
great service and food 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is a great deal 1 
bad purchase 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
awful 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
very disappointing 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
fantastic food 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
disappointed 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
krussel always good 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
simply beautiful 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
will be back again 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
a bit predictable 0 
worthwhile 1 
mediocre food 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
bad quality 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
will not be back 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
great hands free device 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
poor sound quality 0 
excellent 1 
how awful she is 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this phone works great 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
a disappointment 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
piece of trash 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
see it 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
great food 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
totally believable 1 
not recommended 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
not recommended 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
nice design and quality 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
five star plus plus 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
great price too 1 
total waste of time 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this place is great 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
not recommended 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it was horrible 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
that was funny 1 
has been working great 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
its a great item 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
best headset ever 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
not recommended 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
works as described 1 
not what i wanted 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
a great touch 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
disappointing 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
has been working great 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
overall a great experience 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
a bit predictable 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
incredible 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
is pretty funny 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
fantastic food 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
highly recommended 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
a standout scene 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
its just lame 0 
works good 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
never going back 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will definitely be back 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
sooooo good 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the problem was the script 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i loved it 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1
