what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
low quality 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i was so insulted 0 
they have great dinners 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
a great touch 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
id love to go back 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
will not be back 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
great value 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
truly awful 0 
the poor actors 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it was so funny 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
delicious 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
love this product 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
would not go back 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
poor quality 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
bad choice 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
great phone 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
see both films if you can 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
we loved the place 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
food was average at best 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
it just blew 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
magical help 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this phone works great 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
cumbersome design 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
so bad 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the food is good 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this phone works great 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
works for me 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
everything was gross 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
interesting decor 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this is a great deal 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
see both films if you can 1 
piece of trash 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
does not fit 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
its just lame 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the poor actors 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
highly recommended a 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
very very fun chef 1 
very bad experience 0 
gets the job done 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the food is good 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it was equally awful 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
youll love it 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it is not good 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
not recommended 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
mediocre food 0 
just does not work 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i never come again 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
happy so far 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
would not reccommend 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
kind of flops around 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
does not fit 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
nothing new there 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
works good 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
that was funny 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
doesnt work 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
this phone works great 1 
this is a good joint 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the food is good 1 
i wont be back 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
id like to return it 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
its not user friendly 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
how stupid is that 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
its just painful 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
very easy to use 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
stay away from the q 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
good value great food great service 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
very good product well made 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
delicious 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
and it was boring 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
food was average at best 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
easy to use 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i consider this theft 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
defective crap 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
dont buy it 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
not impressed 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
works well 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
great product 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
wow loved this place 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
disappointing experience 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
service is also cute 1 
the cast is good 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
very windresistant 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
very good product well made 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
disapointing results 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
dont miss it 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
love this product 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
nothing new there 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
it looks very nice 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
what a waste of time 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the acting sucked 0 
works great 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the acting was bad 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
that company is a joke 0 
very funny 1 
gets the job done 1 
he was terrible 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i was mortified 0 
a great touch 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
price is good too 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i never come again 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
total brunch fail 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
does not fit 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
poor reliability 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
its a total package 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i would recommend it 1 
awful service 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
terrible service 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
these are fabulous 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
doesnt work 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the food was terrible 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
battery life is also great 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it was so funny 1 
what a mistake 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this pda rocks 1 
again no plot at all 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
poor reliability 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
again lame 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
worth every penny 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
great product for the price 1 
love this product 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
not recommended 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the design is very good4 1 
poor construction 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
service was fantastic 1 
this pda rocks 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i loved it 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
very bad experience 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
they were excellent 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
horrible 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
highly recommended 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
happy so far 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i loved it 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
overall a delight 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
what a mistake 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
very happy with this product 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this is a good joint 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the fries were great too 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
works well 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
worked great 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the food was terrible 0 
everything stinks 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
this is a great deal 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
great price too 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
great product for the price 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
really bad 0 
overall a delight 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
a good time 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
really ugly 0 
and it was boring 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
dont waste your money 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
five star plus plus 1 
warning stay away 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
battery is terrible 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
a standout scene 1 
great case and price 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i heart this place 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it was horrible 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
love this headset 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
1010 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the fries were great too 1 
awful service 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
excellent performance 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i was so insulted 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
it is a true classic 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
worthless product 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
sending it back 0 
i paid too much 0 
this is infuriating 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
very funny 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
good prices 1
