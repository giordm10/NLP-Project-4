the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
disappointed 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the service was meh 0 
gets the job done 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
battery life is also great 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
wow loved this place 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
nice leather 1 
absolutel junk 0 
works for me 1 
everything was gross 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
very good phone 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
see both films if you can 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
excellent phone 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
great choice 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
we loved the place 1 
i wont be back 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
great phone 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
very very sad 0 
best headset ever 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
great price too 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
worthless product 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
see it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i liked it 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
great case and price 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the cast was great 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
gets the job done 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
warning stay away 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
an hour seriously 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
no real improvement 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
cumbersome design 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
works good 1 
why was this film made 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
fantastic food 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
food was really boring 0 
great phone 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i paid too much 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
very disappointed 0 
this is a great deal 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
so just beware 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
buttons are too small 0 
totally believable 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i love it 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
dont buy it 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
great product for the price 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
im super pissd 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
it was horrible 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the food was terrible 0 
do not waste your time 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
awesome service and food 1 
good quality 1 
will order from them again 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it was awesome 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
has been working great 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
very happy with this product 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
no complaints 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
go watch it 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its just painful 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
what a mistake 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
nice leather 1 
good works fine 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
fantastic service here 1 
worst customer service 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
really ugly 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it was equally awful 0 
works for me 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
dont do it 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
good price 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
great charger 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
excellent phone 1 
love this product 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this phone works great 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
everything is appalling 0 
great choice 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
love this product 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
con spotty service 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
worst customer service 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the cast was great 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
better than youd expect 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
1010 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the service was meh 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i would recommend this 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the battery works great 1 
what a waste 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
im returning them 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
interesting decor 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
cool phone 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
you wont regret it 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i would recommend this 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
really awful 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
is pretty funny 1 
disappointed 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i wont be back 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the mic is great 1 
well im satisfied 1 
waste of money 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
it was so funny 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
he was terrible 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
everything was gross 0 
a great touch 1 
1010 1 
the best phone in market 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this place is good 1 
food was really boring 0 
better than expected 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
did not like at all 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
awesome service and food 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
never got it 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
great charger 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
no real improvement 0 
very friendly staff 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
there is no real plot 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the acting was bad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i heart this place 1 
everything stinks 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
they are so cool 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
great product 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
id like to return it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
very disappointing 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
will be back again 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the food was very good 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i love it 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
check it out 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
too politically correct 0 
the acting was bad 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
worthwhile 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
bad reception 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
very disappointed 0 
extremely tasty 1 
excellent 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this case seems well made 1 
too politically correct 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
horrible phone 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it was awesome 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
great product 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
love this headset 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
fast service 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
and it was boring 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
did not like at all 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
so far so good 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
food was delicious 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
does not work 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i wont be back 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
excellent performance 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
very disappointing 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
will be back again 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
great service and food 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
great sound and service 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
it was horrible 0 
waste of money 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
that was funny 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
great sound and service 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
good works fine 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
five star plus plus 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
not my thing 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
very disappointed 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
piece of junk 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
doesnt work 0 
not recommended 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i will not return 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
does not fit 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
five star plus plus 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
very disappointing 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
very funny 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
fantastic service here 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
dont do it 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
poor reliability 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
works for me 1 
no real improvement 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
battery life is also great 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
he was terrible 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this is a great deal 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
easy to use 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
it works 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
its just painful 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
good audio quality 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
a good time 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
eclectic selection 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the battery works great 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
nice sound 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
bad purchase 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
highly recommended a 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
awful service 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
great choice 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
stay away from the q 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it is not good 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
damn good steak 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
we are sending it back 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
not good for the money 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
very disappointed 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1
