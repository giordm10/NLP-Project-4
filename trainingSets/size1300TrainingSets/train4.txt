in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this is a great phone 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
happy so far 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i was so insulted 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
a bit predictable 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
kind of flops around 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
why was this film made 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
warning stay away 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
food was delicious 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
it was awesome 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
simply beautiful 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
just what i wanted 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
does not fit 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
you cant beat that 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
so they performed 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it just blew 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
great earpiece 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
price is good too 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
horrible 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
great phone 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the acting sucked 0 
does not work 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it is an insane game 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
mediocre food 0 
good food good service 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
its just lame 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
poor construction 0 
the food is good 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
1010 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
a great touch 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
will not be back 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
bad choice 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
buttons are too small 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
mediocre food 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i consider this theft 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
waste of money 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
great audio 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
1010 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this is a great little item 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it was so funny 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
very disappointing 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
simply beautiful 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
good case 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i was so insulted 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
how awful she is 0 
brilliant 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
its aggravating 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
mediocre food 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
warning do not buy 0 
poor reliability 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this is a great deal 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
doesnt last long 0 
awful service 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
very friendly staff 1 
yes its that bad 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
does not fit 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
great charger 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
nice sound 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
disappointed 0 
its aggravating 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
dont go here 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
this place has it 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
great phone 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the cast is good 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i want my money back 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
very windresistant 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i paid too much 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the cast is good 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
works for me 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the cast is good 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
battery life is real good 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
not what i wanted 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
1010 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
bad reception 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
not good for the money 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i was mortified 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
awsome device works great 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
what a waste of time 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
brilliant 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
absolutel junk 0 
great choice 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
awesome device 1 
great phone 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the best phone in market 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
what a disappointment 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
disappointed 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
very good quality though 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
good food good service 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i love this place 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
well im satisfied 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
but i dont like it 0 
sending it back 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
its a great item 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
go rent it 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
go rent it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
incredible 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great service and food 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
battery is terrible 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
will order from them again 1 
the acting was bad 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
disappointed 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the food was terrible 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
works fine 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
design flaw 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
extremely tasty 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
worth every penny 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
never got it 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
very prompt service 1 
dont miss it 1 
very disappointing 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
poor reliability 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
great for ipods too 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it is not good 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
bad choice 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
id like to return it 0 
it is not good 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
good item low price 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
fantastic food 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
that was nice 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it is shameful 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
works great 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
id love to go back 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
will order from them again 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
very happy with this product 1 
it is shameful 0 
never going back 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
very prompt service 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
but i dont like it 0 
its aggravating 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
we wont be going back 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
last time buying from you 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
nice ambiance 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
great earpiece 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
both great 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
nice leather 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
everything was gross 0 
both great 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
worst thai ever 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
it works 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
mediocre food 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i want my money back 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
excellent product 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it was equally awful 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the mic is great 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great phone 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
well im satisfied 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
love it great armband 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
nothing new there 0 
it was awesome 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
disappointing experience 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
good price 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
absolutely great 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
so just beware 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
how awesome is that 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
it is not good 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the fries were great too 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
gets the job done 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
how stupid is that 0 
crust is not good 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
nice sound 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
service was fantastic 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
good case 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
works for me 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
disappointing 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
fantastic food 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i love this place 1 
no complaints 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
terrible management 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
service is also cute 1 
works for me 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
total waste of time 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it was awesome 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the block was amazing 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a standout scene 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
con spotty service 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
everything is appalling 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
poor sound quality 0 
good item low price 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
will never ever go back 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
will not be back 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
disappointed 0
