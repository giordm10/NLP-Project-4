unreliable im giving up 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the acting was bad 0 
waste of money 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
worst ever 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i love this place 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
piece of trash 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
good servicecheck 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
its very slow 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i will not return 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
damn good steak 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
very disappointed 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
disappointed 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
con spotty service 0 
sweetest phone 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
everything stinks 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
its pretty easy 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
happy so far 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
it was delicious 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
go and see it 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
great product and price 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
great product 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
just does not work 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
doesnt work 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
dont waste your money 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
but its just not funny 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the acting was bad 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
will not be back 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
buttons are too small 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
mediocre food 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
fantastic food 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
works good 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the food amazing 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
crust is not good 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
better than youd expect 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
amazon sucks 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
doesnt work 0 
everything stinks 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this case seems well made 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
great product and price 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
worst ever 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
sooooo good 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i never come again 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
they were excellent 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
no complaints 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
great choice 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
love this headset 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
great charger 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
crisp and clear 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i will not return 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i heart this place 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
good product good seller 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
great service and food 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the food amazing 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
good transmit audio 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
highly recommended a 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
painful on the ear 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
its not user friendly 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
buttons are too small 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
worth every penny 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the food is good 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i think not again 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
very very sad 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
bad quality 0 
that movie was bad 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
terrible management 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
good works fine 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this is a great little item 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it was not good 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
used and dirty 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
but its just not funny 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
either way it sucks 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
it was a great phone 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
great phone 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
great audio 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
cumbersome design 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
you cant beat that 1 
it is shameful 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
great charger 1 
disappointed 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
really good product 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
great product 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
that was nice 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
disappointing experience 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
disappointed 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
doesnt work 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
really bad 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
great value 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
this is a great little item 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
what a waste 0 
i love this place 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
it was so cool 1 
it was so cool 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
fantastic food 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
id love to go back 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
the food is good 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
painful on the ear 0 
her role was played well 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i waited and waited 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
youll love it 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
that was nice 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i will not return 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
really ugly 0 
item does not match picture 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
it is shameful 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
good transmit audio 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
cumbersome design 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
a good time 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
good prices 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
low quality 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i paid too much 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
very good though 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
works great 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
really good product 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i will not return 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
what a waste 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
excellent short film 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
not recommended 0 
very disappointed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
disapointing results 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
poor sound quality 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
everything was gross 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
good servicecheck 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
why was this film made 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
they are so cool 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
battery life is real good 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
very friendly staff 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
worth every penny 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
good product incredible value 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
an hour seriously 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
very poor service 0 
very prompt service 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
absolutely great 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
works great 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
low quality 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the management is rude 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
disapointing results 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
will order from them again 1 
great phone 1 
owners are really great people 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
very disappointed 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i was mortified 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i wont be back 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
worst martini ever 0
