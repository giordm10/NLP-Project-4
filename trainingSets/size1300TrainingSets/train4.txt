im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
really ugly 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the food was terrible 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
great sound and service 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i wont be back 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
great sound and service 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
worst customer service 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
what a waste 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
disappointing experience 0 
highly recommended a 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
nothing special 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
its a great item 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
it was horrible 0 
1010 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
works well 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
portable and it works 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
we loved the place 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
brilliant 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
great brunch spot 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
service sucks 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
great product 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
really good product 1 
great product for the price 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
this place lacked style 0 
so far so good 1 
overall a great experience 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
mediocre food 0 
good food good service 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
id like to return it 0 
great food 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
it is a true classic 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i heart this place 1 
so bad 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it was packed 0 
battery has no life 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
really awful 0 
really good product 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
so just beware 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
works good 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the food amazing 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the food is good 1 
stay away from the q 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
disappointing 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
these are fabulous 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
worth every penny 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
worst ever 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
poor construction 0 
im pleased 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
highly recommended a 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
brilliant 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
great product and price 1 
not my thing 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
service stinks here 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
im not eating here 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
bad reception 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i wont be back 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
we wont be returning 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
does not fit 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
disappointed 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
nothing special 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
worked great 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
crisp and clear 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
great earpiece 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
buttons are too small 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
nothing special 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
nice sound 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
crisp and clear 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
made very sturdy 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the food was very good 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
great sound and service 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
highly recommended a 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
never going back 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
very good phone 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
disappointing 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
give this one a look 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
really good product 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
wow loved this place 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
mediocre food 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
its very slow 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the battery works great 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
really awful 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
food was average at best 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
good product good seller 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
stay away from the q 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
very displeased 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i paid too much 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
happy so far 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
works great 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
poor reliability 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
nice ambiance 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
very good though 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this is infuriating 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
low quality 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
very displeased 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it looks very nice 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
great product 1 
it was way over fried 0 
disappointing 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
great phone 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
nothing new there 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
they were excellent 1 
warning do not buy 0 
so far so good 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
great brunch spot 1 
they were excellent 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
good transmit audio 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
he was terrible 0 
bad reception 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
good show samsung 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the food is good 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
he was terrible 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
but i dont like it 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i love this thing 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
very easy to use 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it was not good 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
painful on the ear 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the food amazing 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i was mortified 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
these are fabulous 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
very very fun chef 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
what a waste 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
terrible service 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the cast is good 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
awful service 0 
this case seems well made 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
dont waste your time 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i love this thing 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
go and see it 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
design flaw 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
works fine 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
it was delicious 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
bad reception 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
good product incredible value 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
everything stinks 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
worthless product 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
works great 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
dont buy this product 0 
works great 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it is not good 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
great product and price 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
great food 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i think not again 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
her role was played well 1 
it was packed 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
nice sound 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
worst customer service 0 
go and see it 1 
the film is way too long 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i am very happy 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1
