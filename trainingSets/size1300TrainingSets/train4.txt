first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i heart this place 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
nice ambiance 1 
does not fit 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i never come again 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i really liked that 1 
works great 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
im pleased 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
very good though 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
not worth it 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
great product 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
how awesome is that 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i will not return 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
good case 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
terrible service 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the problem was the script 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
dont buy this product 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
great bluetooth 1 
food was average at best 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
how awful she is 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
very disappointed 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i wont be back 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
very poor service 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
very good quality though 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i heart this place 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
service was fantastic 1 
its not user friendly 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
worthwhile 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
absolutel junk 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it is not good 0 
good works fine 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
used and dirty 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
has been working great 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i think not again 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
worst thai ever 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
incredible 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
its not user friendly 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
great phone 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
dont buy this product 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this pda rocks 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
excellent 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it was a great phone 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
bad choice 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
how awful she is 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
so they performed 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
very good product well made 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they have great dinners 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
both great 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
five star plus plus 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
just does not work 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
very funny 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
design flaw 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
warning do not buy 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
im not eating here 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
why was this film made 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
very displeased 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the food is good 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
very good product well made 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the management is rude 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
worthless product 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
good show samsung 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
bad quality 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
sending it back 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
works as described 1 
why was this film made 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
very very sad 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i wont be back 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
they are so cool 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i waited and waited 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
it works 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
this case seems well made 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
not what i wanted 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
either way it sucks 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
battery is terrible 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it was horrendous 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
terrible service 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
dont buy this product 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the food is good 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
service sucks 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
very good quality though 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
not my thing 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
great audio 1 
very funny 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
good product good seller 1 
over rated 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
never got it 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
great phone 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
disappointed 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
very good though 1 
how stupid is that 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
go watch it 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
lousy product 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
this game rocks 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i really liked that 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
good item low price 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
so they performed 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this is a good joint 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
works for me 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
worst thai ever 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i love it 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
great product 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
nice design and quality 1 
over rated 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
this is a great deal 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i love this thing 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
lousy product 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
good item low price 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
not recommended 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
crisp and clear 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
highly recommended 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
worthless product 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
amazon sucks 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
great earpiece 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
just does not work 0 
this is infuriating 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the food was terrible 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
mediocre food 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
highly recommended a 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
horrible 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
great hands free device 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
poor sound quality 0 
very funny 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
great movie 1 
i never come again 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
love this product 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the cast was great 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
piece of trash 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
worthwhile 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i love this place 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
dont buy it 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
nice leather 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
very displeased 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
so far so good 1 
used and dirty 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
so far so good 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
never got it 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
great food 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
fantastic food 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
1010 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
total waste of time 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
bad quality 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
worst ever 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
bad quality 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
great phone 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
incredible 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
love this headset 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
go rent it 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
great phone 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
terrible management 0 
terrible management 0 
eclectic selection 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
great food 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
worthless product 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
its pretty easy 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
very funny 1
