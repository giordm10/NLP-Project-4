excellent product for the price 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
interesting decor 1 
very friendly staff 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
poor construction 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
not my thing 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
fantastic service here 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
wont go back 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
horrible phone 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
dont buy it 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
service is also cute 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
dont miss it 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
not recommended 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i wont be back 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it worked very well 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
very funny 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
this place has it 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
see it 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i love this thing 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
my order was not correct 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
good quality 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
food was below average 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
that was nice 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i never come again 0 
these are fabulous 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
not enough volume 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
good case 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its just lame 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
piece of junk 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
works great 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
disappointed 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
design flaw 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
it was so boring 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
would recommend this item 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the cast is good 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this game rocks 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it was so funny 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
it is shameful 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
great phone 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
price is good too 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
what a disappointment 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
design flaw 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
love this headset 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
id love to go back 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i love this device 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very happy with this product 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
does not work 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
gets the job done 1 
just what i wanted 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
good case excellent value 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
never going back 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
these are fabulous 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the phone loads super 1 
so bad 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the poor actors 0 
again lame 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
either way it sucks 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
simply beautiful 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
my order was not correct 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
they were excellent 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
very windresistant 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the mic is great 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very comfortable 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
wont go back 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
very disappointing 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this is a great deal 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
sweetest phone 1 
service was fantastic 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the food was terrible 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
worth every penny 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
good works fine 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
nice sound 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
great value 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
so far so good 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
a great touch 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
dont waste your money 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this place is amazing 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
battery life is real good 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
poor construction 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
will be back again 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the food amazing 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
magical help 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
warning stay away 0 
they are so cool 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
we loved the place 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
not recommended 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i really liked that 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
highly recommended a 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i love this place 1 
very disappointed 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i love this phone 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
you wont regret it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
that was nice 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
its a total package 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
painful on the ear 0 
really good product 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
great phone 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
worthwhile 1 
very disappointing 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
it was so cool 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
total brunch fail 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
worth every penny 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
nothing special 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
very windresistant 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the mic is great 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
they are so cool 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
will never ever go back 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
design flaw 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this place is amazing 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
its just lame 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
brilliant 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
love this headset 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
good works fine 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the best phone in market 1 
a disappointment 0 
worthless product 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
works as described 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
worst customer service 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it works 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
awesome device 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the food amazing 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this place has it 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i paid too much 0 
he was terrible 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
service was very prompt 1 
incredible 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
used and dirty 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
love it great armband 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
not recommended 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
its aggravating 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i wont be back 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
my order was not correct 0 
wow loved this place 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the problem was the script 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
not my thing 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
magical help 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
how awesome is that 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
great sound and service 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
its pretty easy 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
poor sound quality 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
works great 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
worked great 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
portable and it works 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
made very sturdy 1 
so bad 0 
so just beware 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
again lame 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
disappointed 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
good case excellent value 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
its a total package 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
will be back again 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
that was nice 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
fantastic service here 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
not enough volume 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
low quality 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i love this phone 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
piece of junk 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
good works fine 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
it is not good 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
worst ever 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
better than expected 1 
portable and it works 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
excellent product 1 
really ugly 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the mic is great 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i paid too much 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1
