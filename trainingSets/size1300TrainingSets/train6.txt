this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
very good though 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
terrible management 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
terrible management 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
good value great food great service 1 
we wont be returning 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
works great 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
damn good steak 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
used and dirty 0 
krussel always good 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
it was equally awful 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
poor quality and service 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
not easy to watch 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
1010 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
used and dirty 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
crust is not good 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
what a waste 0 
no complaints 1 
krussel always good 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this is a great phone 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
battery has no life 0 
magical help 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
see both films if you can 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
truly awful 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
im not eating here 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
five star plus plus 1 
does not fit 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
nice ambiance 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
poor quality 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
not easy to watch 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
bad quality 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i heart this place 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
sending it back 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
low quality 0 
price is good too 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
very disappointing 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
very good though 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
good item low price 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
total brunch fail 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the service was meh 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
would not go back 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
its aggravating 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
what a mistake 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
great hands free device 1 
great price too 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
wont go back 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
poor quality and service 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
omit watching this 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the cast is good 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
well im satisfied 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
not my thing 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
just does not work 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
great service and food 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
very disappointed 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
just what i wanted 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it was so cool 1 
id love to go back 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
piece of trash 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
doesnt work 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i would recommend it 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
disappointing 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
wasted two hours 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
food was really boring 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
better than new 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
krussel always good 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
1010 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
used and dirty 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the cast was great 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
food was delicious 1 
does not fit 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
very funny 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
dont waste your time 0 
disappointed 0 
it is shameful 0 
well im satisfied 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
would recommend this item 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
horrible phone 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
dont buy it 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it worked very well 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it was so cool 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
nice design and quality 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the service was meh 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
what a waste 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
overall a great experience 1 
lousy product 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
works great 1 
it was horrible 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
great value 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
incredible 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this game rocks 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
service stinks here 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
great hands free device 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i liked it 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
service stinks here 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it was so boring 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
food was delicious 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
worth every penny 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
very displeased 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
stay away from the q 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
good works fine 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
highly recommended a 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
well never go again 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
better than youd expect 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
crisp and clear 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
krussel always good 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
you wont regret it 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i think not again 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this is infuriating 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
just what i wanted 1 
great value 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
works great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
so just beware 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
good item low price 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
im returning them 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
amazon sucks 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this phone works great 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
portable and it works 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
will be back again 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
how awesome is that 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
1010 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
food was delicious 1 
you wont regret it 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it was so funny 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
very good quality though 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
disappointing 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
hated it 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
would not go back 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
worked great 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the best phone in market 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
not worth it 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
kind of flops around 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
hated it 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
very good phone 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
great hands free device 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
nice leather 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
dont go here 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
awful service 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the block was amazing 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the cast was great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this is a good joint 1 
disappointed 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
it was not good 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
does not fit 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
its just lame 0 
it is not good 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
works as described 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
worthless product 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
excellent product 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great sound and service 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
this place is good 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
would not go back 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
how awful she is 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the design is very good4 1 
its a total package 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
it works 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
will never ever go back 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the fries were great too 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
that was funny 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
mediocre food 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
this place has it 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it worked very well 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the cast is good 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
these are fabulous 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
terrible management 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
worst customer service 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
owners are really great people 1 
hated it 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
krussel always good 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
sooooo good 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
bad choice 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
con spotty service 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i love this phone 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
warning do not buy 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
an hour seriously 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
go watch it 1 
i never come again 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
food was really boring 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this place is good 1 
worst ever 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i never come again 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
it is not good 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
it was packed 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the best phone in market 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
this place is good 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
will definitely be back 1 
worthless product 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
totally believable 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
a great touch 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it was delicious 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
well never go again 0
