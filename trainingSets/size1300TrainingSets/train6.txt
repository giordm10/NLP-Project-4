he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
works great 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
great product and price 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
highly recommended 1 
terrible service 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it was not good 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
a disappointment 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
dont waste your money 0 
nice leather 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
1010 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
it is a true classic 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
nice design and quality 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
its just lame 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
great case and price 1 
this is infuriating 0 
they were excellent 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
so they performed 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
absolutely great 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the food was terrible 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
disapointing results 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
wont go back 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it was horrible 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
total waste of time 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
this is a good joint 1 
bad quality 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
so bad 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
very good phone 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
what a disappointment 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
it was horrible 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
works well 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
krussel always good 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
really bad 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
not recommended 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the food was terrible 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
does not work 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
bad reception 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this is infuriating 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
very good product well made 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
great product 1 
does not work 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the block was amazing 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
overall a delight 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
low quality 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
we loved the place 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
good quality 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it works 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
works as described 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
awesome device 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
very good quality though 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the block was amazing 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
love this headset 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i liked it 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i was so insulted 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
so just beware 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
doesnt work 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
fast service 1 
nothing special 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i waited and waited 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
delicious 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
very disappointing 0 
total waste of time 0 
really ugly 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
would recommend this item 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
defective crap 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
easy to use 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
doesnt last long 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it worked very well 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
great product for the price 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
low quality 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
price is good too 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
good show samsung 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
dont waste your time 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i would recommend this 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
does not fit 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
good quality 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
worst thai ever 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
her role was played well 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
awesome service and food 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i wont be back 0 
poor construction 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
dont waste your time 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the cast is good 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
works good 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
excellent 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
has been working great 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the poor actors 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
worst customer service 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
nice leather 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
design flaw 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
so they performed 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
nice design and quality 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
i love this place 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
great phone 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
dont waste your money 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
warning stay away 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
good value great food great service 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
give this one a look 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
good case excellent value 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
its really easy 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
its just lame 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
see both films if you can 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
no complaints 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
disappointing 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
dont waste your money 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
great food 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
very good phone 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the cast is good 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
a good time 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
really ugly 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i heart this place 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
service was very prompt 1 
design flaw 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
amazon sucks 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
well im satisfied 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
everything was gross 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
go rent it 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
we wont be returning 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
very good phone 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
very good though 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
yes its that bad 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
very disappointing 0 
the food amazing 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i love this device 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
nothing special 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
excellent performance 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
you cant beat that 1 
disapointing results 0 
50 down the drain 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
excellent 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
good food good service 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
very disappointed 0 
i love this thing 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this pda rocks 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
im not eating here 0 
works good 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
it was not good 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
worst martini ever 0 
they were excellent 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it was a great phone 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
very good product well made 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i love this place 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i would recommend this 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
its very slow 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
very poor service 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
not good for the money 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
price is good too 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
good show samsung 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
not easy to watch 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
im super pissd 0 
it was horrendous 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
a disappointment 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
not worth it 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
price is good too 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
service is also cute 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
will not be back 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
fantastic food 1 
crust is not good 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1
