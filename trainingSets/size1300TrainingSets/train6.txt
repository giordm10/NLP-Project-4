i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
battery has no life 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
so bad 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
very easy to use 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it was awesome 1 
service was fantastic 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
awful service 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
good prices 1 
very disappointed 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
a standout scene 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
good audio quality 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
item does not match picture 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
disappointed 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
youll love it 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it was not good 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the poor actors 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
soggy and not good 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
disappointed 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
simply beautiful 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
we wont be going back 0 
excellent 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
excellent service 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
good quality 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
dont buy it 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
that movie was bad 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
it was awesome 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
amazon sucks 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the portion was huge 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
happy so far 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
portable and it works 1 
no complaints 1 
battery life is also great 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
this place is great 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
good item low price 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
poor sound quality 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it works 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
very windresistant 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
it was so funny 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this is a great deal 1 
that company is a joke 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
great product for the price 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
this case seems well made 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it was a great phone 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i am very happy 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
con spotty service 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
this is a great little item 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
totally believable 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it is shameful 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
poor sound quality 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
not recommended 0 
does not fit 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
nothing special 0 
love this product 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
a pretty good product 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it works 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
its not user friendly 0 
this place is great 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
that company is a joke 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i love this place 1 
this game rocks 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
bad reception 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
excellent short film 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
that movie was bad 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
its a great item 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
lousy product 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
not enough volume 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it is not good 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
dont waste your money 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
very disappointing 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
not my thing 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the best phone in market 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
excellent 1 
best headset ever 1 
good prices 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
good food good service 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
battery life is real good 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
great for ipods too 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
good works fine 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i wont be back 0 
so far so good 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the cast was great 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
total brunch fail 0 
really good product 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
very friendly staff 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i paid too much 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
really ugly 0 
delicious 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
waitress was good though 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
horrible phone 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this place has it 1 
sooooo good 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
great phone 1 
works well 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
they are so cool 1 
i consider this theft 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
how awful she is 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
love this phone 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
disappointing 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
nice design and quality 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
everything was gross 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
really good product 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
absolutel junk 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
love it great armband 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
bad quality 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i want my money back 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
great product 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
very displeased 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
works for me 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
will definitely be back 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the battery works great 1 
this case seems well made 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
good item low price 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i consider this theft 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
why was this film made 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the problem was the script 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
im pleased 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i love this device 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
love this phone 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
it was awesome 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
poor construction 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is a great little item 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
not a good bargain 0 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
this is a great phone 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the block was amazing 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
but its just not funny 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
good works fine 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
just what i wanted 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
made very sturdy 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
both great 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it was a great phone 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
cumbersome design 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
not enough volume 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i love this phone 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
great audio 1 
sweetest phone 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
delicious 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
go watch it 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it was horrendous 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
poor sound quality 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
great food 1 
great movie 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
im pleased 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
not recommended 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
piece of junk 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
was not happy 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
five star plus plus 1 
not enough volume 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
not easy to watch 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
its just lame 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
disapointing results 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
excellent service 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
great phone 1 
will definitely be back 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
how stupid is that 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
waitress was good though 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
they have great dinners 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
great phone 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
dont waste your money 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
so they performed 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
waitress was good though 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
nothing special 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
happy so far 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
worked great 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
piece of junk 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0
