the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
very windresistant 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
left very frustrated 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
youll love it 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
worked perfectly 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
very very fun chef 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
everything is appalling 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the mic is great 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
very very sad 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
gets the job done 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
worthless product 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
total brunch fail 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
a disappointment 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
con spotty service 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
great product and price 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
good prices 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
worth every penny 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
they have great dinners 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
excellent product 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this is a great little item 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
piece of trash 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
again no plot at all 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
bad reception 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
waste of money 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
wow loved this place 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
would not go back 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
kind of flops around 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
check it out 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i really liked that 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
disappointed 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
great audio 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
worst martini ever 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
he was terrible 0 
he was terrible 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
nothing special 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
excellent 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
works for me 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
dont miss it 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
not good for the money 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
awesome service and food 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
it was equally awful 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
good audio quality 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
wasted two hours 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
omit watching this 0 
great sound and service 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
we loved the place 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
really awful 0 
no complaints 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i love this thing 1 
disappointed 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
great product for the price 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
easy to use 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
great case and price 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i am very happy 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
they have great dinners 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
bad purchase 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
her role was played well 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
very windresistant 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
what a waste 0 
you wont regret it 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i love this device 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
bad choice 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
love this product 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
sooooo good 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
dont do it 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
good food good service 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
good product good seller 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it was awesome 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
five star plus plus 1 
bad reception 0 
interesting decor 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
best headset ever 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
excellent short film 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
good value great food great service 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
worthwhile 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
disapointing results 0 
what a waste 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
worst phone ever 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
check it out 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i waited and waited 0 
worthwhile 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
did not like at all 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
piece of junk 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
would not reccommend 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
design flaw 0 
is pretty funny 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
soggy and not good 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
waste of money 0 
not recommended 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
how awful she is 0 
im not eating here 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
it was not good 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
dont buy it 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
but its just not funny 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
very very sad 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
disappointed 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
not worth it 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
that was funny 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this place is great 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
it was packed 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
excellent product 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
a disappointment 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
there is no real plot 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it just blew 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
but its just not funny 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
very funny 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the problem was the script 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
dont waste your money 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this pda rocks 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
very disappointing 0 
dont miss it 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
it was awesome 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
would not reccommend 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1

very satisifed with that 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
it works 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0

kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
excellent service 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
never going back 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
food was delicious 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
id love to go back 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1

when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
price is good too 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great audio 1 
poor quality 0 
piece of trash 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i love this thing 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
a great touch 1 
not good for the money 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
will be back again 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
not a good bargain 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
awesome device 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1

this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i never come again 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
great movie 1 
works great 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
excellent service 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
nice ambiance 1 
poor product 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
nothing special 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
very disappointing 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
worst martini ever 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this is infuriating 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0

best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1

the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
not enough volume 0 
bad reception 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0

absolutely great 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
overall a delight 1 
eclectic selection 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
they have great dinners 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
worthless product 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
check it out 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this place is good 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
great audio 1
