but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i was mortified 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
total waste of time 0 
its really easy 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
how awful she is 0 
its pretty easy 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
a disappointment 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
works fine 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
defective crap 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i love this place 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
great choice 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this place is amazing 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
better than new 1 
great audio 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the film is way too long 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this case seems well made 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
works as described 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
not impressed 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
nice sound 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
was not happy 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this game rocks 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
good works fine 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
will be back again 1 
very poor service 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
poor reliability 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
magical help 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
worked great 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
great phone 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
battery is terrible 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
it just blew 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
its a great item 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
bad quality 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
omit watching this 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
very good though 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
go watch it 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i never come again 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the food is good 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
good case excellent value 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
disapointing results 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
everything was gross 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it was packed 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
design flaw 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
this is infuriating 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
you cant beat that 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
everything was gross 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
dont buy this product 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
crisp and clear 1 
not my thing 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
works good 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
why was this film made 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
works as described 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
battery life is real good 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
great service and food 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
great product 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
good item low price 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
will be back again 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
not easy to watch 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
we are sending it back 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
it looks very nice 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
horrible phone 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
simply beautiful 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
its just painful 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it is an insane game 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
poor quality 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
great product 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
love this phone 1 
good food good service 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
good case 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
fantastic food 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
good transmit audio 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
check it out 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
price is good too 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i would recommend this 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
amazon sucks 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
wasted two hours 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
this movie is bad 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
how awesome is that 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
worthless product 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
very good quality though 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very disappointing 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
good food good service 1 
terrible service 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
works as described 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
great phone 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
do not waste your time 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
love this headset 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
its really easy 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
its not user friendly 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
dont buy it 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
will not be back 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
works fine 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
how awful she is 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
not enough volume 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
service sucks 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
sending it back 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i will not return 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
has been working great 1 
the service was meh 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
that was nice 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
better than new 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
defective crap 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
1010 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i wont be back 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
these are fabulous 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
works for me 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
love this headset 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
great phone 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
both great 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
kind of flops around 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great product and price 1 
amazon sucks 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
works for me 1 
nice sound 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
food was really boring 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
so just beware 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
so far so good 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
a good time 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
and it was boring 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
cool phone 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
not easy to watch 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
great product 1 
it is a true classic 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this movie is bad 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
defective crap 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
love this product 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
very good quality though 1 
simply beautiful 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
very good quality though 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
fast service 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
a great touch 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this place has it 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
great for ipods too 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
overall a delight 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
eclectic selection 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
it was so cool 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
excellent 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
you wont regret it 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
dont buy it 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
its just lame 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the battery works great 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this movie is bad 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
not worth it 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i think not again 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
buttons are too small 0 
price is good too 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
works great 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
con spotty service 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
its just painful 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
poor reliability 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i never come again 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
my order was not correct 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
great charger 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
what a waste 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1
