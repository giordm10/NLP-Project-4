all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
interesting decor 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
works great 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
not good for the money 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
good product incredible value 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
good works fine 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
never got it 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
im not eating here 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
hated it 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
very easy to use 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
truly awful 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
sending it back 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
worthwhile 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
so bad 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
poor quality 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
very funny 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
its really easy 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it was so funny 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
it worked very well 1 
no real improvement 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i think not again 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
id love to go back 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
go rent it 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
design flaw 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
better than expected 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
very happy with this product 1 
great phone 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
great food 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i paid too much 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i would recommend it 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
very bad experience 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the film is way too long 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
it was so cool 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
good price 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
a disappointment 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this place is great 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
cumbersome design 0 
doesnt work 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i never come again 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
awful service 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
excellent product 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
poor sound quality 0 
it works 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
awesome service and food 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this place is good 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
it was delicious 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
nice leather 1 
i loved it 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
good product good seller 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
sooooo good 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
its very slow 0 
i want my money back 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i loved it 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
so they performed 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
its just painful 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
dont buy it 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
go watch it 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i love it 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
they were excellent 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
was not happy 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not good for the money 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
see both films if you can 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
never going back 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
1010 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
very very fun chef 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the mic is great 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
love it great armband 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
battery has no life 0 
very happy with this product 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
dont buy it 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
bad purchase 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
was not happy 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
terrible management 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
very disappointed 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
will order from them again 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
omit watching this 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
horrible 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
very bad experience 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
defective crap 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
is pretty funny 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
interesting decor 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
poor reliability 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
dont waste your money 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
it was so cool 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i think not again 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
well never go again 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
just what i wanted 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
really bad 0 
worthless product 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
it was horrible 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
great earpiece 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
its very slow 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
not recommended 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
very happy with this product 1 
so far so good 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
nothing special 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
so bad 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i never come again 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
crust is not good 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
great phone 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
poor quality and service 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
awsome device works great 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
works fine 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
good show samsung 1 
not impressed 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
its just painful 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
it was awesome 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it is not good 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
very disappointing 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i paid too much 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
will not be back 0 
its just lame 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
used and dirty 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
so they performed 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the service was meh 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
great for ipods too 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
go rent it 1 
doesnt last long 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
check it out 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
and it was boring 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
totally believable 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
just what i wanted 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
they were excellent 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
not recommended 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it is not good 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
very disappointing 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
works for me 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
price is good too 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
not recommended 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
great food 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
piece of junk 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
good quality 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
very displeased 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
works for me 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
check it out 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
both great 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i was mortified 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
really good product 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very disappointed 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its a total package 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
great product and price 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
does not work 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i love this place 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
im returning them 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
very friendly staff 1 
great charger 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i will not return 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
great hands free device 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
worst thai ever 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
its just lame 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
go and see it 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this place has it 1 
this is a good joint 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
horrible 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
it is shameful 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
was not happy 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
its very slow 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the problem was the script 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
great brunch spot 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
no real improvement 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
give this one a look 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
good works fine 1 
awesome device 1 
that was funny 1 
the mic is great 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
its a great item 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0
