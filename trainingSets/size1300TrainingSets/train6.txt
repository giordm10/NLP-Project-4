you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
awesome device 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
great phone 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
we loved the place 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
very friendly staff 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
its a total package 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
waste of money 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
food was really boring 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
battery life is also great 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
love it great armband 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i am very happy 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
worst customer service 0 
waste of money 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the film is way too long 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
owners are really great people 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
works for me 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
its just lame 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
total waste of time 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
good audio quality 1 
great value 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
awesome device 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
love it great armband 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
did not like at all 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
low quality 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
really ugly 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
easy to use 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i would recommend this 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
easy to use 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the mic is great 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
has been working great 1 
better than youd expect 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
does not fit 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
love this phone 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
better than youd expect 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
would recommend this item 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
no complaints 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
worth every penny 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
better than expected 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
terrible management 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
never got it 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
it looks very nice 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
delicious 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
good item low price 1 
last time buying from you 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the film is way too long 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it was awesome 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
works as described 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
wow loved this place 1 
will not be back 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
battery is terrible 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
terrible service 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
made very sturdy 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
worst phone ever 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
excellent 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
not my thing 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
dont go here 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
battery is terrible 0 
dont waste your time 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this place has it 1 
owners are really great people 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
they are so cool 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
food was average at best 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the cast is good 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
give this one a look 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
it was horrendous 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
love it great armband 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
we loved the place 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it was awesome 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
awful 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
very disappointing 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
not my thing 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
good quality 1 
i would recommend it 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
good works fine 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
very good quality though 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
worst phone ever 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
works great 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this game rocks 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the problem was the script 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
excellent product 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this pda rocks 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
does not fit 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
has been working great 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
great food 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this pda rocks 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
design flaw 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
excellent product 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
very disappointing 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
works fine 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the acting sucked 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
disapointing results 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it was not good 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
over rated 0 
the battery works great 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
nothing new there 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
works great 1 
great case and price 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
everything was gross 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
great food 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
its just painful 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
nothing new there 0 
so bad 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
great product and price 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
very happy with this product 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
made very sturdy 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i love this place 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
very disappointing 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
did not like at all 0 
awesome device 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the portion was huge 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
works as described 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
a good time 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i waited and waited 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
service was fantastic 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
fantastic food 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
we loved the place 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
this is a great little item 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
interesting decor 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
how stupid is that 0 
good show samsung 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
will order from them again 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
youll love it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
bad quality 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
works great 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
better than youd expect 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
never got it 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sooooo good 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
excellent service 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
how awesome is that 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
wasted two hours 0 
awful service 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the management is rude 0 
very funny 1 
piece of trash 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
disapointing results 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
you wont regret it 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
good servicecheck 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
really ugly 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
great hands free device 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
awful 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
it is shameful 0 
a bit predictable 0 
horrible 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
better than expected 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
that was nice 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
her role was played well 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this case seems well made 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this is infuriating 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the cast was great 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
total brunch fail 0 
again lame 0 
not enough volume 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
its a great item 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
works as described 1 
good prices 1 
item does not match picture 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
will definitely be back 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
did not like at all 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
long whiny and pointless 0
