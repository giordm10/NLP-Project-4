the soundtrack sucked 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i love this phone 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
dont miss it 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
bad reception 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
food was average at best 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this is a great phone 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
very disappointed 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the cast is good 1 
very disappointing 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this is a great deal 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
excellent 1 
highly recommended 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
would not go back 0 
works great 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
did not like at all 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
cool phone 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
poor product 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
everything was gross 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
battery is terrible 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this movie is bad 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
over rated 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
dont go here 0 
it was horrible 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
brilliant 1 
worst customer service 0 
the management is rude 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this place is great 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
very disappointing 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
this phone works great 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
so far so good 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
why was this film made 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
very disappointing 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
good audio quality 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great audio 1 
awful 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
a standout scene 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
very displeased 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is a good joint 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
great sound and service 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
excellent 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
see it 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
crust is not good 0 
not my thing 0 
this game rocks 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
great value 1 
it was equally awful 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
battery life is also great 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
well never go again 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
very disappointed 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
good product good seller 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
great sound and service 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
made very sturdy 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
not recommended 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
amazon sucks 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it is an insane game 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
what a waste 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it was equally awful 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
awful service 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
would recommend this item 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
love this product 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
nothing special 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the phone loads super 1 
better than new 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
great value 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
works great 1 
i consider this theft 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
good case excellent value 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
damn good steak 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
good price 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it is a true classic 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
great product and price 1 
not enough volume 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
1010 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
great phone 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
excellent performance 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
worthless product 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
awesome service and food 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
good item low price 1 
sending it back 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
terrible management 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
does not fit 0 
worthwhile 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
would recommend this item 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
will definitely be back 1 
works for me 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
they were excellent 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
great for ipods too 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
crust is not good 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
brilliant 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
its a great item 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
it is shameful 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
warning stay away 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
everything was gross 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i liked it 1 
horrible 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
worst ever 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
a good time 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
is pretty funny 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this place is good 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
dont waste your money 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
easy to use 1 
great value 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
really good product 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
price is good too 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
totally believable 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it was a great phone 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
is pretty funny 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
will not be back 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
what a disappointment 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
piece of junk 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
great phone 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
works for me 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
disapointing results 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
very displeased 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
dont waste your money 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
service is also cute 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
painful on the ear 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
we wont be going back 0 
excellent 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
warning stay away 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
very very fun chef 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
wow loved this place 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
krussel always good 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
its a great item 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
id love to go back 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
excellent service 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i waited and waited 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
poor reliability 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
very good quality though 1 
it was horrendous 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
excellent phone 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
very happy with this product 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
great case and price 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the food was terrible 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
check it out 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
never going back 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
a standout scene 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
good case 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
go and see it 1 
great phone 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
very disappointing 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
see both films if you can 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
best headset ever 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
wont go back 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
its a total package 1 
so they performed 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
worst thai ever 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
too politically correct 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
disappointing experience 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it looks very nice 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
very bad experience 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
it was awesome 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
good price 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
brilliant 1 
worked great 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
nice ambiance 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
fast service 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
very good though 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i love this place 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
does not fit 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
dont buy it 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the block was amazing 1 
great product 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
so far so good 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
dont buy this product 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
fantastic food 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i want my money back 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1
