the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
good food good service 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
love this product 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
there is no real plot 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
total waste of time 0 
food was average at best 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
dont buy it 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
buttons are too small 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
why was this film made 0 
waste of money 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
will definitely be back 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
we are sending it back 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
great phone 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
best headset ever 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
battery life is real good 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
nothing new there 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
was not happy 0 
they have great dinners 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this movie is bad 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
dont waste your money 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
works great 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
good product good seller 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
defective crap 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
lousy product 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
food was really boring 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the poor actors 0 
just does not work 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
will order from them again 1 
its just painful 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
great product 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
food was really boring 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
painful on the ear 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
no complaints 1 
it was awesome 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
very poor service 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
piece of trash 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
love it great armband 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
very good quality though 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
stay away from the q 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
great hands free device 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
better than expected 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
dont buy this product 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
its just lame 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
horrible 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
worst ever 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
very good product well made 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
everything was gross 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
he was terrible 0 
works great 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
service was fantastic 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
horrible phone 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
better than expected 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the cast is good 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
not impressed 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
very displeased 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it just blew 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i loved it 1 
total waste of time 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
50 down the drain 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
its just painful 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the food is good 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it works 1 
love this headset 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this case seems well made 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
again lame 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the design is very good4 1 
great charger 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
awsome device works great 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
better than new 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
that was nice 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
very disappointed 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
great for ipods too 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
and it was boring 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
will not be back 0 
how awful she is 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
love it great armband 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
over rated 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
nice design and quality 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
he was terrible 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
works as described 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
it was awesome 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
not easy to watch 0 
easy to use 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
well never go again 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
was not happy 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it looks very nice 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
that company is a joke 0 
dont miss it 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the block was amazing 1 
dont buy this product 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
very disappointing 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
was not happy 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
price is good too 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
better than youd expect 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
works great 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
they have great dinners 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
great price also 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it was so funny 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
will order from them again 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
great charger 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
no complaints 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
food was average at best 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
my order was not correct 0 
great service and food 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
a disappointment 0 
good quality 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
they have great dinners 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
buttons are too small 0 
so just beware 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
great audio 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
good price 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
poor quality 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
excellent phone 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
disapointing results 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
dont waste your money 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not recommended 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
that company is a joke 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
good item low price 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
great earpiece 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
interesting decor 1 
both great 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
but i dont like it 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
im returning them 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
very disappointing 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
not recommended 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
how awful she is 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
works for me 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
im super pissd 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
stay away from the q 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
eclectic selection 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
so they performed 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this is infuriating 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
how awful she is 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i love this place 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
good show samsung 1 
this is a good joint 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
incredible 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
what a waste 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
great value 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
he was terrible 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i love this phone 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
not what i wanted 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
great phone 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
item does not match picture 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
great price also 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
not recommended 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
magical help 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
really good product 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
1010 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
worst martini ever 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
a great touch 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
nice design and quality 1 
im pleased 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
does not fit 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
not my thing 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
everything was gross 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
excellent phone 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
great product and price 1 
it was awesome 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
what a waste 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
yes its that bad 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
1010 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
good product good seller 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
sending it back 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
this game rocks 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
good works fine 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
great phone 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
they were excellent 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
dont buy this product 0 
battery is terrible 0 
waitress was good though 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
did not like at all 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
damn good steak 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
go and see it 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this is infuriating 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
love this headset 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0
