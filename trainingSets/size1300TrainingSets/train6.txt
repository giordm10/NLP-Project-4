my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
great product 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
works great 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
interesting decor 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i heart this place 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
soggy and not good 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
great earpiece 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
go rent it 1 
very displeased 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
would not reccommend 0 
see both films if you can 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
we wont be going back 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
good product good seller 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
not enough volume 0 
good case excellent value 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i heart this place 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
a disappointment 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
my order was not correct 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
im not eating here 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
im not eating here 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
buttons are too small 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
absolutely great 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
battery life is real good 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
not impressed 0 
well never go again 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
a disappointment 0 
a great touch 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the management is rude 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
again lame 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
dont buy it 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
dont waste your time 0 
worth every penny 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i love this place 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i want my money back 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
nothing special 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
worth every penny 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
dont buy this product 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the food was terrible 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
last time buying from you 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
but i dont like it 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
battery life is real good 1 
poor product 0 
owners are really great people 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i was mortified 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
it was so funny 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
works great 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
not good for the money 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
not worth it 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
a bit predictable 0 
great price also 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
not impressed 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
very very sad 0 
fantastic service here 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
fantastic food 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
does not work 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
poor product 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
great for ipods too 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the portion was huge 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the problem was the script 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
he was terrible 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
worth every penny 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
again no plot at all 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i loved it 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i loved it 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
it is not good 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
nice sound 1 
very good phone 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this place lacked style 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
how awful she is 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i love this device 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
we wont be returning 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
omit watching this 0 
great phone 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
not easy to watch 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
go rent it 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
does not fit 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this pda rocks 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
its really easy 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
omit watching this 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the management is rude 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
awful 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
you cant beat that 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
works as described 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
a standout scene 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its pretty easy 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i was so insulted 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
great brunch spot 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
not enough volume 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
piece of trash 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the fries were great too 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
poor product 0 
its not user friendly 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
great price also 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
very good quality though 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the problem was the script 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
disappointing 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
excellent performance 1 
bad quality 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
great price too 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i love this device 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i want my money back 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
nothing special 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
no real improvement 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
again no plot at all 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i love this thing 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
worked great 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the food is good 1 
very disappointed 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
give this one a look 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this pda rocks 1 
it was not good 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
but i dont like it 0 
its aggravating 0 
just what i wanted 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
its really easy 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
good prices 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
dont buy it 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
not what i wanted 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
waste of money 0 
this place is amazing 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
dont buy it 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
very easy to use 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
used and dirty 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
good case 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
dont buy it 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
mediocre food 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i consider this theft 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
worst phone ever 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
not impressed 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
lousy product 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
excellent phone 1 
service was very prompt 1 
very disappointed 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
has been working great 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
has been working great 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
what a waste 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
how awful she is 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i love this place 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
is pretty funny 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i loved it 1 
very funny 1 
fast service 1 
so bad 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
good product incredible value 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the block was amazing 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
buttons are too small 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
well never go again 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
best headset ever 1 
nice leather 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0
