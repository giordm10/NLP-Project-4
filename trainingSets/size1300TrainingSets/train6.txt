all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the fries were great too 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
its pretty easy 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great product 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
omit watching this 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
poor construction 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
very disappointing 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
great movie 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
good product good seller 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
highly recommended a 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
its very slow 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
great phone 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
great phone 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it worked very well 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
works well 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
worst ever 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
very prompt service 1 
it is shameful 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
will order from them again 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
we loved the place 1 
worthwhile 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
very comfortable 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
eclectic selection 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
works great 1 
i consider this theft 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
very prompt service 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this is a great little item 1 
it was a great phone 1 
love this product 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this place has it 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
works great 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great phone 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
great for ipods too 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
will order from them again 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
will never ever go back 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
check it out 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
great brunch spot 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
not good for the money 0 
works good 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
fantastic food 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the cast was great 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i love this place 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i waited and waited 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
happy so far 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
worst customer service 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
bad choice 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
that was nice 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i love this phone 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
good prices 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
sooooo good 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
poor reliability 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i love this thing 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
will definitely be back 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
a pretty good product 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
magical help 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
doesnt work 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
it was delicious 1 
worth every penny 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
not what i wanted 0 
see both films if you can 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
not enough volume 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
absolutel junk 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
that was nice 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very friendly staff 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
will not be back 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i am very happy 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
very very sad 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i consider this theft 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
works fine 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
there is no real plot 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
a pretty good product 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
great value 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
poor construction 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is a great deal 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
worked perfectly 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
has been working great 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
very prompt service 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
it was delicious 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
good show samsung 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
soggy and not good 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
sooooo good 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i paid too much 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
has been working great 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i waited and waited 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i really liked that 1 
cool phone 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
works fine 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
waste of money 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
worked great 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
it was packed 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
does not fit 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
really bad 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
great charger 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
is pretty funny 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i was so insulted 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
great charger 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i was so insulted 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
both great 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i liked it 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
horrible phone 0 
either way it sucks 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this case seems well made 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
love this headset 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
excellent phone 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
great phone 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
terrible management 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
good item low price 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
overall a great experience 1 
great phone 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great product for the price 1 
her role was played well 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
love it great armband 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
it was not good 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
did not like at all 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
great phone 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it was so boring 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
warning do not buy 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
it worked very well 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
nice leather 1 
not recommended 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
very easy to use 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
there is no real plot 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
love this headset 1 
i will not return 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
poor construction 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
just does not work 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i wont be back 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i think not again 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
check it out 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
very good quality though 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
not good for the money 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
good product good seller 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
disapointing results 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
do not waste your time 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it is not good 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
its really easy 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
design flaw 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
very good though 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
why was this film made 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
works good 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
good transmit audio 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it was so cool 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
worthless product 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
awful service 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i think not again 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
simply beautiful 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
will never ever go back 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
well never go again 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1
