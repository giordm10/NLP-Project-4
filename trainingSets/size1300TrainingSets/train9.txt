design flaw 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i paid too much 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
very good product well made 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the portion was huge 1 
a great touch 1 
it was not good 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
terrible service 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
bad purchase 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
awful service 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
great product for the price 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
con spotty service 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
very good quality though 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
excellent service 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i waited and waited 0 
this place is good 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
awesome device 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
nice ambiance 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
warning stay away 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i wont be back 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it was equally awful 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
very windresistant 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
item does not match picture 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
very happy with this product 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
very poor service 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
its a total package 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
will definitely be back 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
will definitely be back 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the mic is great 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
left very frustrated 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the food is good 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
con spotty service 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
50 down the drain 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the service was meh 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
happy so far 1 
bad choice 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
terrible service 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it was packed 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the service was meh 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the food was terrible 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
great price also 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
im returning them 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
absolutely great 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
dont buy it 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i paid too much 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
great hands free device 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
works well 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
very prompt service 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
easy to use 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
food was average at best 0 
that movie was bad 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
well never go again 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
there is no real plot 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
worth every penny 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
that was funny 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it just blew 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
very very sad 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
not impressed 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
just what i wanted 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
they were excellent 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
what a disappointment 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
good price 1 
i was mortified 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
very windresistant 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it was horrible 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the cast was great 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
never got it 0 
awsome device works great 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
absolutel junk 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
id love to go back 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
great product and price 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
lousy product 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
what a mistake 0 
service stinks here 0 
nothing special 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
overall a delight 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
so they performed 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
worst customer service 0 
good works fine 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
a great touch 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the film is way too long 0 
this is a great phone 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
great price too 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
worst martini ever 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
totally believable 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
nice sound 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it is an insane game 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
this case seems well made 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
wow loved this place 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it was equally awful 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
works good 1 
its a total package 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
so just beware 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
so far so good 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
it is shameful 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i think not again 0 
sending it back 0 
this pda rocks 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
how stupid is that 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
bad reception 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
they were excellent 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
see it 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
sooooo good 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
good audio quality 1 
her role was played well 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
works as described 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
it looks very nice 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i waited and waited 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
great price also 1 
excellent service 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
really good product 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
food was average at best 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i love this device 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it is a true classic 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
its not user friendly 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
very good though 1 
poor construction 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
incredible 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
doesnt work 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i paid too much 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
would not go back 0 
terrible management 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
happy so far 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this movie is bad 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
disappointing experience 0 
worst ever 0 
highly recommended 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
awsome device works great 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
really ugly 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
we loved the place 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
defective crap 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
great product and price 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it works 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the service was meh 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
service is also cute 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
there is no real plot 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i love this thing 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
im pleased 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
works great 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
overall a delight 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
really ugly 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
her role was played well 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
low quality 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
left very frustrated 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
a great touch 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
worked great 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
worked great 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
poor sound quality 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
good show samsung 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the poor actors 0 
five star plus plus 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
that movie was bad 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
a great touch 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
great value 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it works 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
good quality 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
great product and price 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0
