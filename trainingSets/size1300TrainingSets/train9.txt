but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
its really easy 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
a disappointment 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
again no plot at all 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
total brunch fail 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
not enough volume 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
crust is not good 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the food was terrible 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
krussel always good 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the acting was bad 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
painful on the ear 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the fries were great too 1 
they were excellent 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
this case seems well made 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
again lame 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
crust is not good 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
will be back again 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
works well 1 
go and see it 1 
sending it back 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
a standout scene 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
great phone 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
disappointing 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
crisp and clear 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
love this phone 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
it works 1 
dont buy this product 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
worked great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the food is good 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
how awful she is 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
excellent phone 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
good case 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
great bluetooth 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
horrible phone 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
truly awful 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
works as described 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
very disappointed 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
he was terrible 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
worked great 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
easy to use 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
too politically correct 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
a great touch 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
its very slow 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
great price too 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
five star plus plus 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
warning do not buy 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
no complaints 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
works great 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
you wont regret it 1 
great phone 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
great service and food 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
its a total package 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
good show samsung 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great hands free device 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
fast service 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
really ugly 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
you wont regret it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
easy to use 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
service is also cute 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
con spotty service 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
im pleased 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
over rated 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
they were excellent 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
its a great item 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it looks very nice 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
a standout scene 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
both great 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
terrible service 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
great phone 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
youll love it 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it was horrendous 0 
kind of flops around 0 
great phone 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
very very sad 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
works well 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
warning do not buy 0 
service sucks 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
again lame 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
id love to go back 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
see both films if you can 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
highly recommended 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i waited and waited 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the battery works great 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
will not be back 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
really good product 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
con spotty service 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
so just beware 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the food amazing 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
good works fine 1 
no real improvement 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
everything was gross 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
would not go back 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
nice sound 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it was delicious 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
better than new 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
worked great 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
we wont be going back 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the food was terrible 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
buttons are too small 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great charger 1 
its very slow 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
a pretty good product 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
what a mistake 0 
they have great dinners 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
sending it back 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
worst martini ever 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
excellent short film 1 
her role was played well 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
dont buy it 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
happy so far 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
go rent it 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
how stupid is that 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i will not return 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
crisp and clear 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i waited and waited 0 
magical help 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
great charger 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the design is very good4 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
worst customer service 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it works 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
he was terrible 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
good transmit audio 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
very good though 1 
food was really boring 0 
this movie is bad 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
overall a great experience 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
krussel always good 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
why was this film made 0 
go and see it 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
poor quality 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
awful service 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
nice leather 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
id love to go back 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
it was delicious 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
good food good service 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
warning do not buy 0 
con spotty service 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the film is way too long 0 
really good product 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
great hands free device 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
is pretty funny 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the film is way too long 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
great charger 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
what a waste 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
damn good steak 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
id love to go back 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
there is no real plot 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
love this phone 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
dont buy this product 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
extremely tasty 1 
nice design and quality 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
they are so cool 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
owners are really great people 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
worthless product 0 
it was so cool 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
very disappointing 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
great phone 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
worst ever 0 
great phone 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
good case excellent value 1 
this pda rocks 1 
no complaints 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it was way over fried 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
poor quality and service 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
just what i wanted 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
waste of money 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
no complaints 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
great phone 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
there were too many close ups 0
