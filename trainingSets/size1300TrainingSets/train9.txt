ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
defective crap 0 
very bad experience 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
love this phone 1 
no complaints 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
works as described 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
that was funny 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its a total package 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
terrible service 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
very very fun chef 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the cast is good 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
nice sound 1 
1010 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
it just blew 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
poor product 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
great phone 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
everything was gross 0 
its very slow 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
painful on the ear 0 
it was delicious 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
over rated 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
how awesome is that 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
there is no real plot 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
great product 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
very friendly staff 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
we wont be returning 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
great movie 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
piece of trash 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
mediocre food 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
would not go back 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
terrible management 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
not recommended 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
will order from them again 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
five star plus plus 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
very good phone 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
left very frustrated 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
you cant beat that 1 
nice design and quality 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
price is good too 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
very very fun chef 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
works fine 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
go watch it 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
excellent service 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
dont buy it 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
very good phone 1 
price is good too 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
everything is appalling 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
im returning them 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
best headset ever 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i think not again 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
kind of flops around 0 
portable and it works 1 
nothing new there 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
worst customer service 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the design is very good4 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
terrible management 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
owners are really great people 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the food is good 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
not recommended 0 
great product 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
that company is a joke 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
an hour seriously 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
nothing special 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it was equally awful 0 
waste of money 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
wow loved this place 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
warning stay away 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
interesting decor 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i think not again 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
excellent service 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
a standout scene 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
great sound and service 1 
worthwhile 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
worst ever 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
not worth it 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it just blew 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
great product 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
dont go here 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
not worth it 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
this place is great 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
go rent it 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
cool phone 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
stay away from the q 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this game rocks 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
not recommended 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
good audio quality 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
its just painful 0 
not what i wanted 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
that movie was bad 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
defective crap 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i will not return 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
worthwhile 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
would recommend this item 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the acting was bad 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
they were excellent 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the phone loads super 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
great earpiece 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
very very fun chef 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it was awesome 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
truly awful 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
its very slow 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
how awesome is that 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i think not again 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the fries were great too 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
battery is terrible 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
excellent product 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
excellent short film 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1

see it 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
battery is terrible 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
these are fabulous 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
worst martini ever 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
im returning them 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
its just lame 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
dont miss it 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
they are so cool 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
disappointing experience 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
very very fun chef 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
food was really boring 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
great phone 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the film is way too long 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
omit watching this 0 
best headset ever 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
very windresistant 1 
excellent product 1 
worthless product 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
better than new 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
very good product well made 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
excellent product 1 
its not user friendly 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
the food is good 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
food was delicious 1 
too politically correct 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it was packed 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
its just painful 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
very comfortable 1 
great case and price 1 
works fine 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
stay away from the q 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
good prices 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
worst phone ever 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
good quality 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
very bad experience 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
brilliant 1 
over rated 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
will order from them again 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
dont go here 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
not my thing 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
love this product 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
my order was not correct 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0
