the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
awsome device works great 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
disappointed 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
does not fit 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
great product 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
see it 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
fantastic food 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
everything was gross 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
brilliant 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
so they performed 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
crust is not good 0 
omit watching this 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
great for ipods too 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
will be back again 1 
it is an insane game 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
defective crap 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
great bluetooth 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
very very fun chef 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
why was this film made 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
awesome device 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
1010 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
very disappointing 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
go and see it 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
give this one a look 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
great product and price 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
dont buy this product 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
would recommend this item 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
good food good service 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
disappointing experience 0 
excellent product 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
great earpiece 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
price is good too 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this place is great 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the film is way too long 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
does not fit 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
not good for the money 0 
fast service 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
left very frustrated 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it was so cool 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
but i dont like it 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
not easy to watch 0 
dont buy it 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
works good 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
not my thing 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
excellent product 1 
omit watching this 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
very friendly staff 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
really awful 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
so just beware 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and it was boring 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the design is very good4 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
not worth it 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
you wont regret it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
service stinks here 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
excellent service 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
sooooo good 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
will order from them again 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
very disappointing 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the phone loads super 1 
it was horrible 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the food is good 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i love this phone 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
very prompt service 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
poor quality and service 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
did not like at all 0 
nothing new there 0 
very windresistant 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
nice sound 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
amazon sucks 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
worked great 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i think not again 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it is shameful 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
it is not good 0 
you wont regret it 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i wont be back 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
bad reception 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
a bit predictable 0 
total waste of time 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i love this thing 1 
the management is rude 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
im super pissd 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
dont go here 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
disappointing 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the best phone in market 1 
service stinks here 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
happy so far 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
good product good seller 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
delicious 1 
did not like at all 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
has been working great 1 
damn good steak 1 
but its just not funny 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
both great 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
what a disappointment 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
no real improvement 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the design is very good4 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
it was so funny 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
not enough volume 0 
well im satisfied 1 
im pleased 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
simply beautiful 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
best headset ever 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the design is very good4 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
great for ipods too 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
its not user friendly 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the best phone in market 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
dont waste your money 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
everything stinks 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
how awesome is that 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
yes its that bad 0 
disappointing experience 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
not impressed 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
great value 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
good show samsung 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
five star plus plus 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
not easy to watch 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
its just painful 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
great food 1 
cumbersome design 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
very disappointing 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it was awesome 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
a good time 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
good food good service 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
no real improvement 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
excellent 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
good quality 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
its just lame 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this place is great 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
its just lame 0 
again no plot at all 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
warning stay away 0 
great product for the price 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
has been working great 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
very disappointed 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
low quality 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
food was below average 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
good price 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
a disappointment 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a bit predictable 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i want my money back 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
a good time 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
very happy with this product 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
very funny 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the cast was great 1 
the poor actors 0 
very bad experience 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
poor reliability 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
so far so good 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
service stinks here 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i loved it 1 
service is also cute 1 
mediocre food 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
worth every penny 1 
sending it back 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the fries were great too 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
no real improvement 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it was horrible 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the block was amazing 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
great audio 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
its a great item 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
warning do not buy 0 
how awful she is 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
nice sound 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
everything was gross 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
1010 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
very disappointed 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
good quality 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
this is a great deal 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
and it was boring 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
happy so far 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
dont waste your money 0 
great phone 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
low quality 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
worked great 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
what a waste 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this is a great deal 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
bad reception 0 
dont do it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
you wont regret it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
service sucks 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
everything stinks 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
really good product 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
good price 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0
