this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
everything is appalling 0 
everything stinks 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
her role was played well 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
design flaw 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
highly recommended 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
great food 1 
service sucks 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
very happy with this product 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
go watch it 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
bad reception 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
piece of junk 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
nothing special 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the design is very good4 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
absolutely great 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
very disappointing 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
go and see it 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
love this headset 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
food was average at best 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
great charger 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
used and dirty 0 
it was packed 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
very very fun chef 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
food was really boring 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
1010 1 
better than new 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
really awful 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
good case 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it was packed 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
im super pissd 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the food amazing 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
horrible 0 
works for me 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i want my money back 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
very disappointing 0 
go watch it 1 
does not fit 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
truly awful 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
very displeased 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
love this headset 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
what a waste 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
50 down the drain 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
easy to use 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
just what i wanted 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
very displeased 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
very easy to use 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
five star plus plus 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
disapointing results 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
would not go back 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
how awful she is 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i want my money back 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
there is no real plot 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
happy so far 1 
excellent service 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
i heart this place 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
magical help 1 
1010 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the poor actors 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
great value 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the poor actors 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
eclectic selection 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
good audio quality 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
great brunch spot 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
does not fit 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this game rocks 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
terrible service 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
worst phone ever 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
truly awful 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the phone loads super 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
did not like at all 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
great brunch spot 1 
not impressed 0 
five star plus plus 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
total waste of time 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
never got it 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
good works fine 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
very disappointing 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
very good quality though 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
see both films if you can 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
everything stinks 0 
great product for the price 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
very funny 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
very bad experience 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
warning do not buy 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i paid too much 0 
damn good steak 1 
food was really boring 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
and it was boring 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i never come again 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i really liked that 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
good price 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
piece of trash 0 
was not happy 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
nothing new there 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
battery is terrible 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
awesome device 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
piece of trash 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
lousy product 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
id love to go back 1 
works well 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the poor actors 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
go and see it 1 
it was equally awful 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
dont waste your money 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
awesome device 1 
this game rocks 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
warning stay away 0 
go and see it 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
disapointing results 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
very good phone 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
food was delicious 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
dont buy it 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
worked perfectly 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
magical help 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
krussel always good 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
five star plus plus 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
excellent service 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
well never go again 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
so just beware 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great phone 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
awesome service and food 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
great case and price 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
really good product 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i love this device 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
would not go back 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
works for me 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
very very sad 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
very good product well made 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
great phone 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
last time buying from you 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
used and dirty 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
great product 1 
food was below average 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
really bad 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
sending it back 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
will not be back 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
fantastic food 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i was so insulted 0 
great charger 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
not recommended 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
awful 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
fantastic service here 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
why was this film made 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
very windresistant 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
very disappointing 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
good servicecheck 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
terrible management 0 
very friendly staff 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
last time buying from you 0 
well never go again 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
dont go here 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
simply beautiful 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
very good quality though 1 
never going back 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
sending it back 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the cast was great 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
service sucks 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
works good 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
good price 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
not good for the money 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1
