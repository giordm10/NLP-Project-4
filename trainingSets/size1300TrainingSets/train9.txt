this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
would not go back 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
will not be back 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
a good time 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the portion was huge 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
bad choice 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
warning stay away 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
no real improvement 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i heart this place 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
works as described 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
terrible management 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
made very sturdy 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
love it great armband 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
what a waste 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
just what i wanted 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the management is rude 0 
worst martini ever 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
doesnt last long 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
love it great armband 1 
the management is rude 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great phone 1 
very poor service 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
they are so cool 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
works great 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
very disappointed 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
good product good seller 1 
a disappointment 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
battery has no life 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i think not again 0 
i think not again 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
go and see it 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
worst customer service 0 
great phone 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
dont do it 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
disapointing results 0 
again no plot at all 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
really awful 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
just what i wanted 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
it is not good 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
1010 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
awful service 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
what a disappointment 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
fantastic food 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
a pretty good product 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
not enough volume 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
excellent performance 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
very disappointed 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the cast is good 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
bad choice 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
good case 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
not impressed 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
check it out 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
good audio quality 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i would recommend it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
see both films if you can 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the food amazing 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
very bad experience 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i wont be back 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
but i dont like it 0 
very good phone 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
a pretty good product 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
worked great 1 
the food is good 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
really awful 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
horrible 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
again lame 0 
truly awful 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
great earpiece 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
very poor service 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
service stinks here 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
it is an insane game 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
great value 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
they are so cool 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
wow loved this place 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
a disappointment 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
great sound and service 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
works well 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
not easy to watch 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
very friendly staff 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
we wont be going back 0 
1010 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
this place is amazing 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
what a disappointment 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
good food good service 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
a great touch 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
they have great dinners 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
price is good too 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
bad reception 0 
will be back again 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
just does not work 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
it was not good 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
worst ever 0 
im super pissd 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
just what i wanted 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
best headset ever 1 
a pretty good product 1 
service was very prompt 1 
great case and price 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
good show samsung 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
they are so cool 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
its very slow 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the acting was bad 0 
good food good service 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
it was equally awful 0 
excellent 1 
i love this place 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
worst martini ever 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the poor actors 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
great food 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it worked very well 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
lousy product 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
very good quality though 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
service was very prompt 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
how awesome is that 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
really bad 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
works fine 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
good case 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
battery has no life 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
best headset ever 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
extremely tasty 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
a bit predictable 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
con spotty service 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i love this place 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
incredible 1 
very good phone 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
go watch it 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
works fine 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
con spotty service 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
poor quality 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
both great 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
does not work 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it was horrendous 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
so far so good 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the acting sucked 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
a great touch 1 
was not happy 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
excellent phone 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
stay away from the q 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
too politically correct 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
sweetest phone 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
a standout scene 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
incredible 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
will be back again 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
awful 0 
works great 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
will never ever go back 0 
battery life is real good 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
doesnt last long 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
how awesome is that 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
great food 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
im pleased 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
no complaints 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
very funny 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
it was packed 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
very friendly staff 1 
awsome device works great 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i love this device 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it was not good 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
works great 1 
defective crap 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
very very fun chef 1 
krussel always good 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
works great 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i am very happy 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
works great 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i would recommend it 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
im super pissd 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it was not good 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
works great 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
so far so good 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
used and dirty 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0
