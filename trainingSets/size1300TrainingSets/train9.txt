the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the food was very good 1 
this is a good joint 1 
yes its that bad 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
not my thing 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
id love to go back 1 
great for ipods too 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
terrible management 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
piece of trash 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
krussel always good 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
omit watching this 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
highly recommended 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
battery has no life 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
everything was gross 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
im returning them 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
used and dirty 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
omit watching this 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
not what i wanted 0 
will not be back 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this game rocks 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
that was funny 1 
would not reccommend 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the food was terrible 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
we loved the place 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
awsome device works great 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
simply beautiful 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
damn good steak 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
very prompt service 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
left very frustrated 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
too politically correct 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
interesting decor 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
doesnt work 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
terrible management 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
very easy to use 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
its a great item 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
either way it sucks 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i love this place 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very disappointed 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
very happy with this product 1 
works as described 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
awesome service and food 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it was so funny 1 
bad reception 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
what a waste 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
waste of money 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it was not good 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
great service and food 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
great charger 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
great earpiece 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
fast service 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
it was way over fried 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
really bad 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
nothing special 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
both great 1 
food was really boring 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
good case excellent value 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great hands free device 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
very disappointed 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
good food good service 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
fantastic food 1 
hated it 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
poor reliability 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this phone works great 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
piece of trash 0 
a good time 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the cast is good 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
excellent 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
hated it 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
very good phone 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the food amazing 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
great product and price 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
poor quality 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
great food 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
works good 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
very prompt service 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
great choice 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
love this headset 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
very bad experience 0 
hated it 0 
very good phone 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
we wont be going back 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
doesnt work 0 
both great 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
fantastic food 1 
go rent it 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
amazon sucks 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
im not eating here 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
damn good steak 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
great for ipods too 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
good case 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
warning do not buy 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it was a great phone 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the phone loads super 1 
lousy product 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
bad quality 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great case and price 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
price is good too 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
both great 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it just blew 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
poor product 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
will not be back 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
eclectic selection 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
highly recommended a 1 
excellent short film 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this game rocks 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
not recommended 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
doesnt last long 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i paid too much 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
food was really boring 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
overall a delight 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i would recommend it 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
worthwhile 1 
great phone 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
worst thai ever 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
great bluetooth 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
highly recommended 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
overall a great experience 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
happy so far 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
nothing new there 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
truly awful 0 
very easy to use 1 
worthwhile 1 
you cant beat that 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
gets the job done 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
its a great item 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this is a great little item 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
delicious 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
never going back 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this is infuriating 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this place is good 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
very disappointed 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place has it 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
no real improvement 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
highly recommended 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
a disappointment 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
what a mistake 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
very displeased 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this phone works great 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
a great touch 1 
service sucks 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
lousy product 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
doesnt work 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it was awesome 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
very disappointing 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
incredible 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i really liked that 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
nice leather 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
awsome device works great 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
great phone 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
very displeased 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
go and see it 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
that company is a joke 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the cast is good 1 
id love to go back 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
eclectic selection 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
good price 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
total brunch fail 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the poor actors 0 
the film is way too long 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
doesnt work 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
dont do it 0 
is pretty funny 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
is pretty funny 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
what a waste 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
interesting decor 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
and it was boring 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
bad purchase 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
how awful she is 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
im not eating here 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
disappointed 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i love this place 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
total brunch fail 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
check it out 1 
piece of junk 0 
fantastic food 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
what a disappointment 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1
