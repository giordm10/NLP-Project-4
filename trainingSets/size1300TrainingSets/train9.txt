i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
wasted two hours 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
sooooo good 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
a standout scene 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the food amazing 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i would recommend it 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
poor quality 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the service was meh 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
a standout scene 1 
im not eating here 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
very very fun chef 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it was way over fried 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it worked very well 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the block was amazing 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
very bad experience 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
owners are really great people 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
works for me 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
amazon sucks 0 
damn good steak 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
happy so far 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the food was very good 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it is a true classic 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
great phone 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
not what i wanted 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
awful 0 
dont miss it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
worth every penny 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
does not work 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this game rocks 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
piece of junk 0 
very disappointed 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
these are fabulous 1 
overall a great experience 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
well never go again 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
great price too 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
disappointed 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it was so boring 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
really awful 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
it was awesome 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i would recommend it 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
dont buy it 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
great earpiece 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
you cant beat that 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it is shameful 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
would not go back 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
extremely tasty 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this is a great deal 1 
disappointing 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
very comfortable 1 
amazon sucks 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
really bad 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
see it 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
1010 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this place is amazing 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
really awful 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
bad purchase 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
great phone 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
so they performed 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i love this place 1 
very disappointing 0 
mediocre food 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
great value 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
best headset ever 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
very good phone 1 
a standout scene 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
food was delicious 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
excellent short film 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
has been working great 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
how awful she is 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
would not reccommend 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
how stupid is that 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
that was nice 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it works 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
im not eating here 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the food was very good 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
1010 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it was packed 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
dont miss it 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i waited and waited 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
bad purchase 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i would recommend it 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
design flaw 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
gets the job done 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
dont buy it 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i love this place 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
very good phone 1 
warning do not buy 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
id love to go back 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
absolutely great 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
bad quality 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
absolutel junk 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
terrible service 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
this is a great little item 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
there is no real plot 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
excellent phone 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
its very slow 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
both great 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
that was funny 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
excellent 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
over rated 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
horrible phone 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
works for me 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the food was terrible 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
dont buy this product 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
design flaw 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
disappointing 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
service was very prompt 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
we wont be going back 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
it was so funny 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
price is good too 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
battery has no life 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
very very sad 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
that was nice 1 
we loved the place 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
amazon sucks 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
wasted two hours 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the best phone in market 1 
painful on the ear 0 
worthwhile 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
easy to use 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
it was so funny 1 
will never ever go back 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
love this headset 1 
better than new 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
absolutely great 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
design flaw 0 
nice leather 1 
so far so good 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this is infuriating 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
will order from them again 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
worked great 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
great value 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
total brunch fail 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
it is shameful 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
con spotty service 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
that company is a joke 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
great sound and service 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i was mortified 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
design flaw 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
sweetest phone 1 
very easy to use 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
awful service 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
dont miss it 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this place is great 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
brilliant 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
very good quality though 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this phone works great 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i think not again 0 
worst martini ever 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the poor actors 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
extremely tasty 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
will not be back 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the cast was great 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
was not happy 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
better than expected 1 
fast service 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the battery works great 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
a great touch 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1
