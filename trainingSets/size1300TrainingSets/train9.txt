i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
does not work 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
so just beware 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this is a great little item 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
nice leather 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
will be back again 1 
terrible management 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
has been working great 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
that movie was bad 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
what a waste of time 0 
overall a delight 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
total brunch fail 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
very good phone 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it was awesome 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
best headset ever 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
great price too 1 
excellent performance 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
bad purchase 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great phone 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
well im satisfied 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
dont waste your money 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
this is a good joint 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
it was so funny 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
bad choice 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
nice ambiance 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is a great phone 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
disappointed 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
nice leather 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the best phone in market 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
disapointing results 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
highly recommended 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
her role was played well 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
nice ambiance 1 
really ugly 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
works as described 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
disappointing 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
great price also 1 
very disappointing 0 
piece of trash 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
lousy product 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
great movie 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
it was so funny 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
her role was played well 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the acting was bad 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
really bad 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
works great 1 
i would recommend this 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
bad reception 0 
worthless product 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
great hands free device 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i loved it 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
not enough volume 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i love it 1 
wasted two hours 0 
very friendly staff 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it was equally awful 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
great phone 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
youll love it 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
good quality 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
my order was not correct 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
very good though 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
very good phone 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
better than youd expect 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i really liked that 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i waited and waited 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
buttons are too small 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
never got it 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this case seems well made 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
very good phone 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
really good product 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
awsome device works great 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
its a great item 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
great charger 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
nothing special 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it was a great phone 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
service sucks 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
was not happy 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
dont go here 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i want my money back 0 
worst customer service 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
everything was gross 0 
it was equally awful 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i think not again 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
great hands free device 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
very disappointing 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
wasted two hours 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i never come again 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
poor sound quality 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
great product 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the battery works great 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
good food good service 1 
disappointing 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
great hands free device 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
soggy and not good 0 
excellent product 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
excellent product 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
worst ever 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
go rent it 1 
the mic is great 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
it was so boring 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
food was average at best 0 
works as described 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
great price also 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
too politically correct 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the battery works great 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
it works 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
so far so good 1 
its a great item 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
better than youd expect 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
great price also 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i waited and waited 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
dont buy this product 0 
disapointing results 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
it was a great phone 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
its just lame 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the acting was bad 0 
works great 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i wont be back 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
disappointed 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the portion was huge 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
portable and it works 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i loved it 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
this place has it 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
overall a great experience 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
works great 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
good works fine 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
horrible phone 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
so they performed 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
very disappointing 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
what a disappointment 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
defective crap 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
excellent short film 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
very very sad 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
better than youd expect 1 
you cant beat that 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
great case and price 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
dont buy it 0 
its just painful 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it was packed 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i will not return 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
they are so cool 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
extremely tasty 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the portion was huge 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i love this phone 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
its just painful 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
good quality 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
an hour seriously 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
over rated 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
what a mistake 0 
nothing special 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
check it out 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
its not user friendly 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
good food good service 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
brilliant 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
really ugly 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
worthless product 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
excellent product 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
so they performed 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
what a waste of time 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the battery works great 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
great product and price 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
magical help 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
great audio 1 
left very frustrated 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
dont do it 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
battery has no life 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great phone 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
youll love it 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the food was very good 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
overall a great experience 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
great phone 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i wont be back 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
good quality 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1
