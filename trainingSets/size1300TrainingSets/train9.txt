it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
better than expected 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the poor actors 0 
horrible phone 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i love this phone 1 
the film is way too long 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
awesome device 1 
best headset ever 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
this place is great 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the acting was bad 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
great sound and service 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
great sound and service 1 
very disappointing 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
will be back again 1 
sooooo good 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this place is amazing 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
that was nice 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
but its just not funny 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
better than new 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
cool phone 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
we loved the place 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the portion was huge 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
krussel always good 1 
does not fit 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
waste of money 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
great phone 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
absolutely great 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
bad choice 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
portable and it works 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i want my money back 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
works as described 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
these are fabulous 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
awesome service and food 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
truly awful 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
will not be back 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
magical help 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i love this place 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
left very frustrated 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
terrible service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this place lacked style 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the acting was bad 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
not easy to watch 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
good food good service 1 
disappointing 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
dont waste your money 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
a pretty good product 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it was awesome 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
not worth it 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
dont waste your money 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
its a total package 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
better than expected 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it was delicious 1 
very poor service 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
its pretty easy 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
brilliant 1 
worst customer service 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
not my thing 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
not good for the money 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
how awful she is 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
good works fine 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
delicious 1 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
no real improvement 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
love it great armband 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
highly recommended a 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
not impressed 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
food was average at best 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
bad choice 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
again lame 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
yes its that bad 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i love this device 1 
the food was very good 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
how stupid is that 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
service was very prompt 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
no real improvement 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
a good time 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
good value great food great service 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the fries were great too 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
very disappointing 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i would recommend it 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this movie is bad 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the best phone in market 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
great food 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this is a great deal 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
but its just not funny 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i liked it 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
this place is great 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
so far so good 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
bad reception 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
a good time 1 
this game rocks 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
this is a great little item 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
works for me 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
dont waste your money 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
nice ambiance 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
horrible 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
great audio 1 
terrible service 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
horrible phone 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
not good for the money 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
this place is amazing 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
owners are really great people 1 
not easy to watch 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
its just painful 0 
better than expected 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i will not return 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
works great 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
interesting decor 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
will not be back 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
again no plot at all 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
this game rocks 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
very good though 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
there is no real plot 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
dont go here 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
this is a great phone 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
works for me 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
great phone 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
great food 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
does not fit 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
very easy to use 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
really good product 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
this case seems well made 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
that movie was bad 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the food was very good 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
better than new 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
doesnt last long 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
food was really boring 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
absolutely great 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
worth every penny 1 
im returning them 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
doesnt last long 0 
buttons are too small 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
it just blew 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
waitress was good though 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
excellent 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
poor product 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
so far so good 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
last time buying from you 0 
we loved the place 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
an hour seriously 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
mediocre food 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
sooooo good 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
works fine 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
absolutely great 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
crust is not good 0 
great price too 1 
that company is a joke 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
very easy to use 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
so far so good 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
dont waste your money 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
dont go here 0 
better than youd expect 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great charger 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
will order from them again 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
they are so cool 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
fantastic food 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
item does not match picture 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
a standout scene 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
overall a delight 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
just does not work 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
no real improvement 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
has been working great 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it was delicious 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
not impressed 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
nice ambiance 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
im returning them 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
piece of trash 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
better than youd expect 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the best phone in market 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
no real improvement 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
1010 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
food was average at best 0 
the design is very good4 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
cumbersome design 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
amazon sucks 0 
yes its that bad 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
fantastic food 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
a bit predictable 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it was not good 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
will be back again 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
worth every penny 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0
