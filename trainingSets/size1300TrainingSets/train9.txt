the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
disappointing 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the portion was huge 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
not impressed 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
fast service 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
service sucks 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
go rent it 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the design is very good4 1 
good show samsung 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this pda rocks 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
not recommended 0 
everything was gross 0 
used and dirty 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
great price too 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
im not eating here 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
its a total package 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
worked great 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
love this phone 1 
good item low price 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
very easy to use 1 
the design is very good4 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
good product incredible value 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
kind of flops around 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
piece of junk 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
too politically correct 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
great brunch spot 1 
my order was not correct 0 
bad reception 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
really bad 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
poor sound quality 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i love this thing 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
krussel always good 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
horrible phone 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
not recommended 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
too politically correct 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
battery is terrible 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
waste of money 0 
the food amazing 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
not recommended 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
too politically correct 0 
that was nice 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
not impressed 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
a standout scene 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
too politically correct 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
waste of money 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
you cant beat that 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
50 down the drain 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
excellent 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
worst martini ever 0 
battery life is also great 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
good servicecheck 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
great product and price 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i liked it 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
delicious 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
what a disappointment 0 
service was very prompt 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
a disappointment 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
will never ever go back 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
good prices 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
you wont regret it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
overall a great experience 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the poor actors 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great food 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
very funny 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
really good product 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
does not fit 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
1010 1 
good case 1 
bad quality 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
a standout scene 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the fries were great too 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
very bad experience 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
bad choice 0 
i want my money back 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
good item low price 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
dont miss it 1 
no complaints 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
a great touch 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
wont go back 0 
well never go again 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
its really easy 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
fantastic service here 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
terrible management 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
great phone 1 
good works fine 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
no complaints 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
poor product 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
you wont regret it 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
great phone 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
worst ever 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the acting was bad 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
works good 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
very good though 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i would recommend it 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the cast is good 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
excellent short film 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
its pretty easy 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
great phone 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
great phone 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
not my thing 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
did not like at all 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
what a disappointment 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the cast was great 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
dont buy this product 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
owners are really great people 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
a great touch 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
good works fine 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
great phone 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
does not fit 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
dont buy it 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this is a great little item 1 
great charger 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this place is great 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
dont waste your money 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
great price also 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
worthless product 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
very good though 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
kind of flops around 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
food was really boring 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
good works fine 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
cool phone 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
again lame 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
magical help 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
worst martini ever 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
mediocre food 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
it worked very well 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
very good product well made 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
sooooo good 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
will definitely be back 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
a good time 1 
would not go back 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
food was delicious 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the acting was bad 0 
poor quality 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
dont miss it 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
painful on the ear 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
do not waste your time 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
it was so funny 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
works great 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
does not work 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
crisp and clear 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
a standout scene 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
cumbersome design 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
id love to go back 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
not what i wanted 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
nice leather 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
wont go back 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
good case excellent value 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i would recommend it 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
not a good bargain 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
give this one a look 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
left very frustrated 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
its just lame 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
works for me 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this is a great deal 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the poor actors 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i really liked that 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
awful 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
over rated 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
no real improvement 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
awful 0 
it is a true classic 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
works for me 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
works well 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
no real improvement 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
bad quality 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this game rocks 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
love this product 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
do not waste your time 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
does not fit 0 
made very sturdy 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this place is great 1 
used and dirty 0 
not a good bargain 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the poor actors 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
bad reception 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0
