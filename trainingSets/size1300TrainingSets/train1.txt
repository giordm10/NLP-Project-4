if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
good product incredible value 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
excellent product 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the food was terrible 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
disapointing results 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
awful service 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
poor construction 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
you wont regret it 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
nice design and quality 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
works good 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the management is rude 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
awful 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
everything is appalling 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
fantastic service here 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
not recommended 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
go and see it 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
dont waste your money 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
they are so cool 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
awesome device 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
it just blew 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
service sucks 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
cool phone 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
just what i wanted 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
does not fit 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
warning stay away 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
it was packed 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
disappointing 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
absolutely great 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
they have great dinners 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
disappointed 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
food was delicious 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
design flaw 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
1010 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this place is good 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
good value great food great service 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
very friendly staff 1 
nice leather 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
great choice 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
dont miss it 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
dont miss it 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
see it 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
it is an insane game 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the best phone in market 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
its just lame 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the poor actors 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
would recommend this item 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
good price 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
great value 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
good food good service 1 
happy so far 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
not easy to watch 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
dont do it 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
1010 1 
i liked it 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
go and see it 1 
its just painful 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
very comfortable 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the film is way too long 0 
so far so good 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
excellent product 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
dont waste your money 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
love this headset 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
great sound and service 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
left very frustrated 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
works for me 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
what a waste of time 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
made very sturdy 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
very good though 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
very poor service 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it was horrendous 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
great value 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
but its just not funny 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
1010 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
does not fit 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
not recommended 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
1010 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
really bad 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
did not like at all 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
will not be back 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
what a waste 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
food was delicious 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the poor actors 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
they are so cool 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
great phone 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
not worth it 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
really bad 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i love this place 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
worst martini ever 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
worst customer service 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
works for me 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i was mortified 0 
love this headset 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this case seems well made 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i love this place 1 
love this product 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
very funny 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
item does not match picture 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
love this phone 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
how stupid is that 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
worked perfectly 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
we wont be returning 0 
worth every penny 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
love this phone 1 
that movie was bad 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
would not go back 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
very disappointing 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this place is good 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
do not waste your time 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
nice leather 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
we wont be returning 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
great for ipods too 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i want my money back 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
food was average at best 0 
magical help 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
best headset ever 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
im returning them 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
not impressed 0 
very good though 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
damn good steak 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
best headset ever 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
what a waste 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
very very fun chef 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
very friendly staff 1 
they were excellent 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
better than expected 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
worked great 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
either way it sucks 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
great audio 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
disappointed 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
good audio quality 1 
it is shameful 0 
it works 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
well im satisfied 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
great hands free device 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
really ugly 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i want my money back 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
its just painful 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
worst martini ever 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
incredible 1 
works as described 1 
painful on the ear 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
disappointed 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
very poor service 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
awful 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the battery works great 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
did not like at all 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
interesting decor 1 
was not happy 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
design flaw 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
great hands free device 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
poor reliability 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
im pleased 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
not good for the money 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
its just lame 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
never got it 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
great choice 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it just blew 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i love this thing 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great price also 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
poor construction 0 
it is shameful 0 
they are so cool 1 
good case 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
poor construction 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
very comfortable 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0
