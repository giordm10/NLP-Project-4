pretty good beer selection too 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
food was delicious 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
food was average at best 0 
better than youd expect 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
horrible 0 
dont waste your time 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
we loved the place 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
great phone 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
very comfortable 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
very disappointing 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
would recommend this item 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the poor actors 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
great sound and service 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
stay away from the q 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
food was really boring 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
good food good service 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not good for the money 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
absolutel junk 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
why was this film made 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
worthless product 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
very prompt service 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
great price too 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
food was really boring 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
omit watching this 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
overall a delight 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
waitress was good though 1 
defective crap 0 
the cast was great 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
total waste of time 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
poor product 0 
very easy to use 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
total waste of time 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
both great 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the mic is great 1 
not my thing 0 
overall a great experience 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this is infuriating 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
dont do it 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
never got it 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
these are fabulous 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i liked it 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
not easy to watch 0 
works great 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
nice ambiance 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the problem was the script 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
great phone 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
id love to go back 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
check it out 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
cool phone 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
stay away from the q 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
battery is terrible 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
very good product well made 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
awesome service and food 1 
dont go here 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
left very frustrated 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
horrible phone 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
service sucks 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i waited and waited 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
highly recommended a 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
im super pissd 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the cast was great 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
poor sound quality 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
youll love it 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
youll love it 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
fantastic food 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
krussel always good 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
service was very prompt 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
cool phone 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
great audio 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
fantastic food 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
great price also 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
its just painful 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
very funny 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
service stinks here 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
love this headset 1 
im not eating here 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the food was terrible 0 
very very sad 0 
good case 1 
very very fun chef 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
painful on the ear 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i waited and waited 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the cast was great 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it is not good 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this place lacked style 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
battery has no life 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
1010 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
awful service 0 
it worked very well 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
what a waste 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
very very fun chef 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i will not return 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the poor actors 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
stay away from the q 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the cast was great 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
con spotty service 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
very disappointing 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
truly awful 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
works fine 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i love this thing 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
brilliant 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
good product incredible value 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the acting sucked 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
cumbersome design 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
food was really boring 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
worth every penny 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it just blew 0 
great price too 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
its very slow 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
good product good seller 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
love this product 1 
nice sound 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
wasted two hours 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this pda rocks 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great product 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
piece of trash 0 
really bad 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it is an insane game 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
so they performed 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i love this phone 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
its pretty easy 1 
give this one a look 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i will not return 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
disappointing experience 0 
bad reception 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
good quality 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
dont waste your money 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
battery has no life 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i love it 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
awesome service and food 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
amazon sucks 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
extremely tasty 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
simply beautiful 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
do not waste your time 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
made very sturdy 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
works fine 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this is a good joint 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
worst customer service 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
im super pissd 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
good product good seller 1 
great phone 1 
love it great armband 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
disappointed 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its just painful 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this game rocks 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
did not like at all 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
cool phone 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
cumbersome design 0 
happy so far 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
works great 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
you wont regret it 1 
food was delicious 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
service sucks 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
great phone 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i heart this place 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
50 down the drain 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
great phone 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it was so cool 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0
