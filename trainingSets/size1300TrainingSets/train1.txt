but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
did not like at all 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great value 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
excellent performance 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
her role was played well 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
happy so far 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
give this one a look 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
does not fit 0 
stay away from the q 0 
sooooo good 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
design flaw 0 
the best phone in market 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
easy to use 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
excellent 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it is not good 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
damn good steak 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
and it was boring 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
bad quality 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
left very frustrated 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
doesnt last long 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
great price too 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
terrible management 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
will be back again 1 
the block was amazing 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
disappointed 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i would recommend it 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
its a total package 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
worthless product 0 
too politically correct 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i paid too much 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
gets the job done 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
good item low price 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
total brunch fail 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
nice sound 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
this place is great 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i love this thing 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
better than youd expect 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
not recommended 0 
very very fun chef 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the food was terrible 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
worth every penny 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
damn good steak 1 
that was funny 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
check it out 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
it works 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
wow loved this place 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
both great 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
good item low price 1 
nothing special 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
will not be back 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
really bad 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
good works fine 1 
will order from them again 1 
dont waste your money 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
design flaw 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i was mortified 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
poor quality 0 
piece of trash 0 
great bluetooth 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
nothing new there 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
gets the job done 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the poor actors 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
1010 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i consider this theft 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i was so insulted 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
easy to use 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
go watch it 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
this is a great deal 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
is pretty funny 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i never come again 0 
better than new 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
not good for the money 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
really ugly 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the problem was the script 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
portable and it works 1 
disappointing 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
dont waste your money 0 
very funny 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
great earpiece 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
will order from them again 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
good item low price 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
gets the job done 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
it works 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
they are so cool 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
disappointed 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
it was so boring 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
used and dirty 0 
great brunch spot 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
very very sad 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
either way it sucks 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it was so funny 1 
well im satisfied 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
great movie 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
bad reception 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
see it 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
horrible phone 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
its very slow 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
con spotty service 0 
both great 1 
both great 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
its not user friendly 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this is a great little item 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
last time buying from you 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the mic is great 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
truly awful 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
what a waste 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
we loved the place 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
really bad 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the phone loads super 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
amazon sucks 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the design is very good4 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i loved it 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
poor reliability 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
so they performed 1 
not recommended 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i consider this theft 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the mic is great 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
1010 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
its a total package 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
not my thing 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
will not be back 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this is a great deal 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great case and price 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
its just painful 0 
both great 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the service was meh 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
good product good seller 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
bad purchase 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
you cant beat that 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
id like to return it 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the food is good 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
worth every penny 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
very very fun chef 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
worst customer service 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
good item low price 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i was mortified 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
crisp and clear 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
is pretty funny 1 
nothing special 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
piece of junk 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
how awesome is that 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
terrible service 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
im super pissd 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i will not return 0 
why was this film made 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
not recommended 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
piece of trash 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
what a mistake 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
yes its that bad 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
im pleased 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the phone loads super 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
works good 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the cast is good 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
what a mistake 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
cool phone 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
interesting decor 1 
great bluetooth 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
id like to return it 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
used and dirty 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
both great 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i loved it 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
happy so far 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
see both films if you can 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it works 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
service was fantastic 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
food was below average 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
left very frustrated 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
works as described 1 
both great 1 
1010 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the problem was the script 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the mic is great 1 
its really easy 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
this is a stunning movie 1
