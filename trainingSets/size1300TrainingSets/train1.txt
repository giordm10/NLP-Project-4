i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
love this headset 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
service is also cute 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
worked great 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
you wont regret it 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
not recommended 0 
it was packed 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
over rated 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
its aggravating 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
how stupid is that 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
truly awful 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
not good for the money 0 
absolutely great 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
works fine 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
great audio 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
doesnt last long 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it works 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it was delicious 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
krussel always good 1 
i was mortified 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
it was so cool 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
excellent 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
totally believable 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
great case and price 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
bad reception 0 
not recommended 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
battery life is real good 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
what a mistake 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
a standout scene 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
disappointing experience 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i am very happy 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
how stupid is that 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
very disappointed 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
both great 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it was so funny 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
awful service 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
very good quality though 1 
cumbersome design 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
a pretty good product 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
her role was played well 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
everything was gross 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
not easy to watch 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
easy to use 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the management is rude 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
warning stay away 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
awful service 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
owners are really great people 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
the fries were great too 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the problem was the script 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
great phone 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
great value 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
it was horrendous 0 
worst thai ever 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
give this one a look 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
her role was played well 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
everything was gross 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
krussel always good 1 
disappointed 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
works great 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
great product for the price 1 
see it 1 
i love this device 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
fantastic food 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i loved it 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
battery has no life 0 
its a total package 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
dont buy this product 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it is shameful 0 
i heart this place 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the phone loads super 1 
dont buy this product 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it just blew 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the food amazing 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
sooooo good 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
horrible phone 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
poor product 0 
and it was boring 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
its really easy 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
great choice 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the management is rude 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
will definitely be back 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
worst customer service 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
go rent it 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
very bad experience 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the food was very good 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
very easy to use 1 
warning stay away 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
damn good steak 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
great product and price 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
1010 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
very disappointed 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
we loved the place 1 
has been working great 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the acting sucked 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
that was funny 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
it was way over fried 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
its not user friendly 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
1010 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this phone works great 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
again no plot at all 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it was awesome 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the food amazing 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
terrible service 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
everything stinks 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
poor quality 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i paid too much 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
excellent 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this is a great deal 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
both great 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
awful 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
youll love it 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
just what i wanted 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i love this phone 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
good case excellent value 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
battery is terrible 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
better than expected 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the problem was the script 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
it was so boring 0 
con spotty service 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
owners are really great people 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
crust is not good 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it was so funny 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
doesnt last long 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
very disappointing 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this phone works great 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
he was terrible 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
not what i wanted 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
good case excellent value 1 
service stinks here 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
not what i wanted 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
horrible 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
how awful she is 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
sending it back 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
it was not good 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
just does not work 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
love this product 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
very good though 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
does not fit 0 
worth every penny 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
good prices 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
how awful she is 0 
i think not again 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
very disappointing 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
incredible 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
go rent it 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
crust is not good 0 
disapointing results 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
awesome device 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the food is good 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
great price too 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
good show samsung 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
absolutel junk 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
it is not good 0 
i loved it 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i liked it 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
damn good steak 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
nice leather 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
excellent performance 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the cast is good 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
happy so far 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
good audio quality 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
very funny 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
great hands free device 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
service stinks here 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
love this headset 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
great phone 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
great price too 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
a standout scene 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0
