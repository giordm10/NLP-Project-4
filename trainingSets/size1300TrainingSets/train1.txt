best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
very disappointing 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
waitress was good though 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
disappointed 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
disapointing results 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the best phone in market 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
disappointing experience 0 
worked perfectly 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i love this thing 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
magical help 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
does not work 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
im not eating here 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i love this place 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
it is not good 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
a standout scene 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
so far so good 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
does not work 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
bad reception 0 
very disappointed 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
worst ever 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
does not fit 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i want my money back 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
very disappointing 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
service sucks 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this game rocks 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i liked it 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
check it out 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
what a disappointment 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
just does not work 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
simply beautiful 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
bad reception 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
good quality 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
design flaw 0 
piece of junk 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
what a mistake 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great bluetooth 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it was equally awful 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
not impressed 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i love this device 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
it was horrible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
excellent performance 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
truly awful 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
good audio quality 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
excellent performance 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i want my money back 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
used and dirty 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
very disappointed 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
so they performed 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
everything stinks 0 
best headset ever 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
does not fit 0 
a good time 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
awesome service and food 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
love this product 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
terrible management 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
poor sound quality 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i love this place 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
not a good bargain 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
fantastic food 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
no real improvement 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
bad quality 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
good prices 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
works good 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
we wont be going back 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
great earpiece 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
will definitely be back 1 
used and dirty 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
its a great item 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
fast service 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
warning stay away 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
cumbersome design 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
this movie is bad 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
con spotty service 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
food was really boring 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it was horrendous 0 
very easy to use 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
that company is a joke 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
kind of flops around 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the block was amazing 1 
five star plus plus 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
its very slow 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
how awful she is 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
excellent product 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
but its just not funny 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
nice design and quality 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
works as described 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the management is rude 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
service was fantastic 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
you wont regret it 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
crust is not good 0 
works as described 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
very windresistant 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
too politically correct 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
nice ambiance 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
very disappointing 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the food was very good 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
excellent short film 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
good audio quality 1 
great movie 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
excellent short film 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
her role was played well 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
very disappointed 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
overall a great experience 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i will not return 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
crisp and clear 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
very disappointed 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
id like to return it 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
dont waste your time 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
very good quality though 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
an hour seriously 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
very good quality though 1 
i think not again 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
no complaints 1 
both great 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
very comfortable 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
a great touch 1 
everything stinks 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
truly awful 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
truly awful 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
an hour seriously 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
that company is a joke 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
great for ipods too 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i love this device 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the food was very good 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
very bad experience 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
the problem was the script 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
sending it back 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i consider this theft 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
extremely tasty 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
happy so far 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
we are sending it back 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
he was terrible 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
great movie 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this is a great deal 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
worked great 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
magical help 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
five star plus plus 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
its pretty easy 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it was horrible 0 
very bad experience 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
check it out 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
service was fantastic 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
owners are really great people 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
wasted two hours 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
a standout scene 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
her role was played well 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
great audio 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
will be back again 1 
battery has no life 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
simply beautiful 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
has been working great 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i really liked that 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
excellent service 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
what a mistake 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
over rated 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
it was horrible 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0
