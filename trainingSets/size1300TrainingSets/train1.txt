i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
dont miss it 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the cast was great 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
very good though 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
again lame 0 
im super pissd 0 
interesting decor 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
magical help 1 
a pretty good product 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
great phone 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
food was really boring 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
this place has it 1 
i love this phone 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
its really easy 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it just blew 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this game rocks 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
service sucks 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
better than new 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
do not waste your time 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
good value great food great service 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
its not user friendly 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
will not be back 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the best phone in market 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
everything stinks 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
good works fine 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
delicious 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
terrible service 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
brilliant 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
battery is terrible 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
was not happy 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
dont buy it 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the mic is great 1 
again no plot at all 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
battery has no life 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
wow loved this place 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
worst customer service 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
worst thai ever 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i am very happy 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
good audio quality 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
service sucks 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
will order from them again 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
great phone 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
either way it sucks 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
better than new 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great phone 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
not recommended 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
low quality 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
not recommended 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
dont buy it 0 
worst thai ever 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it worked very well 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
very comfortable 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
this is a great deal 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
great choice 1 
worst customer service 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
highly recommended a 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
disapointing results 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
good works fine 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
made very sturdy 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
was not happy 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
excellent product 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
damn good steak 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
worst ever 0 
1010 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
its just lame 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
highly recommended 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
great value 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
good audio quality 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
piece of junk 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
works great 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
disappointed 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
great for ipods too 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
nice sound 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
works great 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
cool phone 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
price is good too 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
a pretty good product 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
never got it 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
crisp and clear 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
im super pissd 0 
works for me 1 
sweetest phone 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
it was awesome 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
dont buy it 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
that movie was bad 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
a good time 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the phone loads super 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
bad purchase 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
a pretty good product 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
im super pissd 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i love it 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
doesnt last long 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
these are fabulous 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
good quality 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
well never go again 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
we wont be returning 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
that movie was bad 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it just blew 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
worst phone ever 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
never got it 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
owners are really great people 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
good show samsung 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
very comfortable 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
low quality 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i want my money back 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i was mortified 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
better than expected 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
not my thing 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
it was so funny 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the acting sucked 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
bad choice 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
great phone 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
service was very prompt 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
how awful she is 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
very disappointed 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
disappointing experience 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this place is good 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
disapointing results 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
see it 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
great product 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
its a total package 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
too politically correct 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
good product incredible value 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
this game rocks 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
dont buy it 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
great choice 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
its pretty easy 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it was a great phone 1 
dont go here 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
great sound and service 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
he was terrible 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
there is no real plot 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
great hands free device 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
great choice 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
disappointing experience 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
im not eating here 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
owners are really great people 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
youll love it 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
never got it 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
absolutely great 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
doesnt last long 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
eclectic selection 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i would recommend it 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
either way it sucks 0 
worked great 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i will not return 0 
excellent short film 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it is shameful 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the fries were great too 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
worthless product 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
piece of junk 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1
