but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great earpiece 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
a great touch 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
omit watching this 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is a good joint 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
battery life is real good 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
see it 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
it was horrendous 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i liked it 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
dont waste your time 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this game rocks 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
good price 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
what a waste of time 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
very poor service 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
food was delicious 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
not my thing 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i never come again 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
nothing special 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
does not fit 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
great sound and service 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
not enough volume 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i heart this place 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
you cant beat that 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
low quality 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it was way over fried 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
that was nice 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
so they performed 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
go rent it 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
has been working great 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
why was this film made 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
truly awful 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
very disappointed 0 
we wont be going back 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i am very happy 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
buttons are too small 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the problem was the script 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
fantastic service here 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
dont waste your money 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
lousy product 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the mic is great 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
very funny 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
overall a great experience 1 
hated it 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
1010 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
has been working great 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
its aggravating 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it worked very well 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it is not good 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
waitress was good though 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this game rocks 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
great price too 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
not what i wanted 0 
awful 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it looks very nice 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
worth every penny 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
im super pissd 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
very disappointing 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
id love to go back 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
very windresistant 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
it was delicious 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the food amazing 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i was so insulted 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the battery works great 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the phone loads super 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
this is a good joint 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
sooooo good 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
does not work 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
will be back again 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
great phone 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
con spotty service 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
warning stay away 0 
dont miss it 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the mic is great 1 
wasted two hours 0 
will never ever go back 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
will order from them again 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
my order was not correct 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
worth every penny 1 
im returning them 0 
food was below average 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
its a great item 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
a standout scene 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
price is good too 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
wasted two hours 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
its a total package 1 
what a mistake 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
waste of money 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
stay away from the q 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
terrible service 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
very poor service 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i was mortified 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i am very happy 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
again no plot at all 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
five star plus plus 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
see both films if you can 1 
really good product 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
sweetest phone 1 
service was fantastic 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
crust is not good 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
very happy with this product 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
very disappointed 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the cast was great 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
does not work 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
really ugly 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
will be back again 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
an hour seriously 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
great product for the price 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
crust is not good 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
how awful she is 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
just what i wanted 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
food was delicious 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
how awesome is that 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it was not good 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
a bit predictable 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it was horrible 0 
there is no real plot 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
nice ambiance 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
very comfortable 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the food was terrible 0 
battery life is real good 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
worst ever 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
great product 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
it was equally awful 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
better than expected 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
it was so boring 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the food is good 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i want my money back 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
awsome device works great 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
really bad 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
dont do it 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
good prices 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
low quality 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
that was nice 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
very very fun chef 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
excellent performance 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
really good product 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
good case 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
works good 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
bad quality 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
portable and it works 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
works for me 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
great choice 1 
nice sound 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
stay away from the q 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
excellent product 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the problem was the script 0 
crust is not good 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
absolutely great 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
sweetest phone 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
very disappointed 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i waited and waited 0 
bad quality 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this phone works great 1 
disappointed 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
not recommended 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
food was below average 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
again no plot at all 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
damn good steak 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
good prices 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
battery life is also great 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
very displeased 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this place is great 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
stay away from the q 0 
the cast was great 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i wont be back 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0
