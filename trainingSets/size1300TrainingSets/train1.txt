the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
its really easy 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
owners are really great people 1 
very disappointing 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
you wont regret it 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
go and see it 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
no real improvement 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
great service and food 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
great for ipods too 1 
works great 1 
very friendly staff 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
omit watching this 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
bad choice 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
brilliant 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
low quality 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
wow loved this place 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i would recommend this 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i heart this place 1 
food was really boring 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
works great 1 
has been working great 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
just what i wanted 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i waited and waited 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
very displeased 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
con spotty service 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
very good phone 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
crisp and clear 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
terrible service 0 
highly recommended 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
it is a true classic 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
not recommended 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
overall a delight 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
no real improvement 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
good case excellent value 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
im not eating here 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
poor reliability 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
piece of trash 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
very prompt service 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
really awful 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
very good phone 1 
go watch it 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
it was so cool 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
dont buy it 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
what a disappointment 0 
1010 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it just blew 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it was packed 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
piece of junk 0 
yes its that bad 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
very disappointed 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the food is good 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
terrible service 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
interesting decor 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
good transmit audio 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
total waste of time 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
love this product 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
its very slow 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
fast service 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
mediocre food 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
see it 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it worked very well 1 
i wont be back 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
price is good too 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
magical help 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
so far so good 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
fast service 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
over rated 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it looks very nice 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
dont buy it 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
poor quality and service 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
good product good seller 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
soggy and not good 0 
mediocre food 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
very funny 1 
i would recommend it 1 
they were excellent 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
disappointing 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
very good product well made 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
disappointed 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
good transmit audio 1 
was not happy 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
incredible 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
very prompt service 1 
works as described 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
good works fine 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
great product 1 
poor reliability 0 
this place is great 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i would recommend this 1 
brilliant 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
dont waste your money 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
great phone 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
great value 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
nice ambiance 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
brilliant 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
not a good bargain 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
and it was boring 0 
worked great 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
so bad 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i loved it 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
good product good seller 1 
dont buy this product 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
bad quality 0 
great product for the price 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
worked perfectly 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this place has it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
great choice 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
used and dirty 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
its aggravating 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i love this thing 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the design is very good4 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it is not good 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
im not eating here 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
great product and price 1 
nothing special 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
youll love it 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
love this product 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
excellent 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i waited and waited 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
works for me 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
not worth it 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
sooooo good 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
never going back 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
piece of junk 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this pda rocks 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
fantastic food 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it is a true classic 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
so just beware 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
so they performed 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
terrible service 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
great choice 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it was a great phone 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
that was nice 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
nice ambiance 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
great product and price 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i never come again 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
worst customer service 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
total brunch fail 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i never come again 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
a good time 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
battery has no life 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
too politically correct 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
that was nice 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
brilliant 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
very prompt service 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
worked great 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
painful on the ear 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i waited and waited 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
highly recommended 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i would recommend it 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
good audio quality 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
disappointed 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
works for me 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great choice 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
its a great item 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
really awful 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
good food good service 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
great charger 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
nice ambiance 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
has been working great 1 
this game rocks 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
nice leather 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
nice sound 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
worked great 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
its very slow 0 
mediocre food 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
id love to go back 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
omit watching this 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it was delicious 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the food is good 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the problem was the script 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
not easy to watch 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
very disappointed 0 
never going back 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
not my thing 0 
food was really boring 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
a disappointment 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
low quality 0 
you wont regret it 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the fries were great too 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
yes its that bad 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
what a mistake 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
check it out 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
go watch it 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1
