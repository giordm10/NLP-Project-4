it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
it was equally awful 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
excellent phone 1 
1010 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
its aggravating 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
awful 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
really awful 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
its just lame 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
absolutely great 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great sound and service 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
fantastic food 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
would not reccommend 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
piece of trash 0 
food was delicious 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
works good 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it was a great phone 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the food amazing 1 
great food 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
works good 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
how awful she is 0 
bad choice 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it was equally awful 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
worst thai ever 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
poor quality and service 0 
why was this film made 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the acting sucked 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
very good though 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it was delicious 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
poor quality and service 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
really awful 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
happy so far 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
i want my money back 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
great price too 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
great earpiece 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
he was terrible 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great brunch spot 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
fantastic service here 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
not enough volume 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
nice sound 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
kind of flops around 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
it was awesome 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
very good phone 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
waitress was good though 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it is shameful 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
last time buying from you 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie is bad 0 
it was so funny 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
cool phone 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
nice sound 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
i am very happy 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great product and price 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
love it great armband 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
a great touch 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
piece of junk 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
wow loved this place 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
this is a great deal 1 
bad reception 0 
what a mistake 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
everything was gross 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
a disappointment 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
horrible phone 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
good product good seller 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
very good phone 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i think not again 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
incredible 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
hated it 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
does not fit 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
these are fabulous 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
everything was gross 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
food was delicious 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i wont be back 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
never going back 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
poor construction 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
battery has no life 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
worth every penny 1 
the block was amazing 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the design is very good4 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
will be back again 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i never come again 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
great brunch spot 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
warning stay away 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
works great 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
a standout scene 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
never got it 0 
i am very happy 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
kind of flops around 0 
cool phone 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
very very sad 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
simply beautiful 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
im not eating here 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
lousy product 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
poor product 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
it was way over fried 0 
does not fit 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
1010 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
great food 1 
worked great 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
my order was not correct 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
good case 1 
how awful she is 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this place is good 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
works fine 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
1010 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
very good product well made 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
good product incredible value 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a pretty good product 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
worthwhile 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
not impressed 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the food was very good 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
easy to use 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
mediocre food 0 
the design is very good4 1 
battery has no life 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
very poor service 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
so far so good 1 
very disappointed 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
total brunch fail 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
disappointing experience 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it is an insane game 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
its just lame 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
service stinks here 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
incredible 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
worthwhile 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it is shameful 0 
does not fit 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
nice ambiance 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
great phone 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
cumbersome design 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the food amazing 1 
works good 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
it just blew 0 
go rent it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
waste of money 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
it was packed 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
dont waste your money 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the fries were great too 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
you wont regret it 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
not what i wanted 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
its not user friendly 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
its just lame 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
disappointing 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it works 1 
i heart this place 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
fantastic service here 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
great product and price 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the acting was bad 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
what a mistake 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i was mortified 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great phone 1 
you cant beat that 1 
too politically correct 0 
very funny 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
sweetest phone 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
terrible service 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this phone works great 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
works as described 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it is not good 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it was delicious 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the food was very good 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this phone works great 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
terrible management 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
cumbersome design 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
excellent 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
nice sound 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the phone loads super 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
1010 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
buttons are too small 0 
id like to return it 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
waste of money 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
just what i wanted 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
very disappointed 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the cast was great 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
very good phone 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
dont waste your money 0 
go and see it 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
how awful she is 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
bad purchase 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1
