in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
works good 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
good product incredible value 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
very happy with this product 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
poor quality 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
good product incredible value 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
that company is a joke 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
very disappointing 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
great phone 1 
this is infuriating 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
magical help 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
highly recommended a 1 
very poor service 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
very bad experience 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
it was way over fried 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the food was terrible 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
dont do it 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
not my thing 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
a great touch 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
worst customer service 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
worst customer service 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
go rent it 1 
not my thing 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the film is way too long 0 
im super pissd 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
love this product 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it was a great phone 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
works good 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i will not return 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i would recommend it 1 
its just painful 0 
so they performed 1 
great earpiece 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
terrible management 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it just blew 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
not recommended 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
dont do it 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
not recommended 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
poor quality 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
terrible service 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
very disappointed 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
it is not good 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
what a waste 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
they are so cool 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
dont waste your money 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
awesome device 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
delicious 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
not good for the money 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
these are fabulous 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
why was this film made 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
good case 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
its a total package 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
would not go back 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
awesome service and food 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
its pretty easy 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
very disappointing 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
they are so cool 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
either way it sucks 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
give this one a look 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the block was amazing 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i really liked that 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
never going back 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
good case excellent value 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
defective crap 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i think not again 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
price is good too 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
horrible 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
excellent product 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
best headset ever 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
worst martini ever 0 
this is a great little item 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this place has it 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
id love to go back 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not impressed 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
eclectic selection 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
awful 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
simply beautiful 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the food was very good 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the service was meh 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
worst customer service 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
poor product 0 
not recommended 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
has been working great 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
great charger 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
it was so cool 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the food was terrible 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
incredible 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
overall a great experience 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
im super pissd 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
totally believable 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
absolutel junk 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it was awesome 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
nice design and quality 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
piece of junk 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
works great 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
absolutely great 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the block was amazing 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
a disappointment 0 
why was this film made 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
would not go back 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
works good 1 
dont do it 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
works for me 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
nothing new there 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
waitress was good though 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
does not work 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
service sucks 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
love this product 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
it is a true classic 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
good food good service 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i liked it 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
good item low price 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i want my money back 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
absolutel junk 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
will order from them again 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great earpiece 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
poor quality 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
brilliant 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
very disappointing 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
this is infuriating 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
excellent product 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
fantastic food 1 
this place lacked style 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i would recommend it 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
food was delicious 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i love it 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
good case 1 
love this headset 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
so bad 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
they have great dinners 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it worked very well 1 
the best phone in market 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
it is not good 0 
amazon sucks 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this phone works great 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the food was very good 1 
will order from them again 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
its pretty easy 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
it is an insane game 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
so far so good 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
her role was played well 1 
it was not good 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
works great 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
good servicecheck 1 
great brunch spot 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
not easy to watch 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
lousy product 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
never got it 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
just what i wanted 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
hated it 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i will not return 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
lousy product 0 
1010 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
bad quality 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
what a waste 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
good value great food great service 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
did not like at all 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
low quality 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i think not again 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
fast service 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this place is great 1 
it has kept up very well 1
