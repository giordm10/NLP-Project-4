i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
very good product well made 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
service is also cute 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the fries were great too 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
good case excellent value 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
would recommend this item 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
what a waste 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
we wont be returning 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
dont buy it 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
amazon sucks 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
a bit predictable 0 
absolutel junk 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
this is a great phone 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
give this one a look 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i will not return 0 
worthless product 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
never got it 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
again lame 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
fantastic food 1 
both great 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
design flaw 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
it was so funny 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
that was nice 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
do not waste your time 0 
good price 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
but its just not funny 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
food was delicious 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
excellent phone 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i paid too much 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
would not go back 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i want my money back 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
go rent it 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
piece of junk 0 
dont buy this product 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
total waste of time 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this game rocks 1 
buttons are too small 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
so bad 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
nice leather 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
why was this film made 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
piece of trash 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
good value great food great service 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
awsome device works great 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
brilliant 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
too politically correct 0 
good show samsung 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
would not go back 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
love this headset 1 
has been working great 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the food amazing 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
good audio quality 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
totally believable 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
no real improvement 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
poor sound quality 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
love it great armband 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i love it 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
very prompt service 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the cast is good 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
but its just not funny 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
warning do not buy 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the cast was great 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
very easy to use 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
good show samsung 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it was packed 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
everything was gross 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
good food good service 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
so bad 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
its very slow 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i love this place 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
yes its that bad 0 
a bit predictable 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
and it was boring 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
used and dirty 0 
i consider this theft 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
totally believable 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
disappointing 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
really awful 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
not my thing 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
service is also cute 1 
sweetest phone 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
you cant beat that 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
awesome device 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
excellent service 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
again lame 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
go rent it 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
very easy to use 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
dont buy it 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
total waste of time 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
a bit predictable 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
worst thai ever 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
both great 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
no complaints 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
good quality 1 
excellent performance 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i want my money back 0 
this place is great 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
this phone works great 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i loved it 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
not recommended 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
bad reception 0 
it was a great phone 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
no real improvement 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
worthless product 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
sooooo good 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
but its just not funny 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i love this phone 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
great phone 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
mediocre food 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i am very happy 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
cool phone 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
poor construction 0

the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
just does not work 0 
really good product 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
dont buy this product 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i wont be back 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
worst phone ever 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
check it out 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
its a great item 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
great value 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
waste of money 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
not a good bargain 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i would recommend this 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
great value 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
poor product 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i would recommend this 1 
these are fabulous 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
this movie is bad 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
worst thai ever 0 
gets the job done 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
nice sound 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
has been working great 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
they are so cool 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
fantastic service here 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the food is good 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
works well 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
check it out 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
good servicecheck 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
its a total package 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i love this place 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
dont miss it 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
im not eating here 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the food was terrible 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
the management is rude 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
this movie is bad 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
its just lame 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is a great deal 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i am very happy 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
its a total package 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i want my money back 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
sweetest phone 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
awesome service and food 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
eclectic selection 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
poor sound quality 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
has been working great 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
go rent it 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1
