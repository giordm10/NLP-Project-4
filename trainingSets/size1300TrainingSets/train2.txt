never had anything to complain about here 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
five star plus plus 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
piece of trash 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
great phone 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
great charger 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
food was average at best 0 
excellent short film 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
design flaw 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
works fine 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the food is good 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
so far so good 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i paid too much 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
good quality 1 
great phone 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
gets the job done 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
used and dirty 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
magical help 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
these are fabulous 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
great price too 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
do not waste your time 0 
eclectic selection 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
im not eating here 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
con spotty service 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
awful service 0 
great product and price 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
her role was played well 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
better than expected 1 
im super pissd 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
left very frustrated 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
made very sturdy 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
no real improvement 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it was awesome 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
con spotty service 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this place lacked style 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
highly recommended 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
its really easy 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
owners are really great people 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
great phone 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
nothing new there 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
love this headset 1 
very prompt service 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this is a great deal 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
works great 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
so far so good 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
best headset ever 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
price is good too 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the acting was bad 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
wont go back 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
item does not match picture 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
a good time 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it is shameful 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
works fine 1 
good show samsung 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
better than new 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
great sound and service 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
this is a great phone 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
so just beware 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
nothing new there 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
there is no real plot 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
service was fantastic 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i really liked that 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it was horrendous 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
sooooo good 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
so bad 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
great service and food 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
very comfortable 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
dont miss it 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the food was terrible 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
its just painful 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the portion was huge 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
will order from them again 1 
worked great 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
why was this film made 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
love this headset 1 
the cast is good 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
incredible 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
excellent 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
it just blew 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
amazon sucks 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
great brunch spot 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
dont waste your money 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
an hour seriously 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
damn good steak 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
was not happy 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
it is shameful 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i was so insulted 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i really liked that 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
con spotty service 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
did not like at all 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
worked perfectly 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
better than new 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
good prices 1 
sooooo good 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
service sucks 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
they are so cool 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
this case seems well made 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
excellent phone 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
good product good seller 1 
good transmit audio 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
will order from them again 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
everything stinks 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
he was terrible 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
bad quality 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
dont do it 0 
highly recommended a 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
food was delicious 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
total waste of time 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
very good quality though 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
both great 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
very friendly staff 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
not worth it 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
awesome device 1 
service was fantastic 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this is a great deal 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
wasted two hours 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
used and dirty 0 
good quality 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
it is shameful 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
does not fit 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
gets the job done 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
we wont be going back 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
cumbersome design 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
horrible phone 0 
well never go again 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
better than new 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
great service and food 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
everything stinks 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
sending it back 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
it is a true classic 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
so bad 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
really ugly 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
a standout scene 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
everything was gross 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the film is way too long 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
delicious 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
never going back 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
kind of flops around 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
well never go again 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the problem was the script 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
battery is terrible 0 
easy to use 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
i love it 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
im not eating here 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0
