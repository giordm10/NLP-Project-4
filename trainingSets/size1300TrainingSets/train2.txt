i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
everything was gross 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
love this phone 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
they were excellent 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
extremely tasty 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
too politically correct 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
so far so good 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
disappointing experience 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
this is a great little item 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i think not again 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the block was amazing 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
disappointed 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
waste of money 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
absolutely great 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the design is very good4 1 
great charger 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
so bad 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
great product and price 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the problem was the script 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
they have great dinners 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
not what i wanted 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
very poor service 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
low quality 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
very happy with this product 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
good case 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
good case 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
youll love it 1 
did not like at all 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
see both films if you can 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
service sucks 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
and it was boring 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
it just blew 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
nice ambiance 1 
food was average at best 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
very disappointing 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
piece of junk 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
very funny 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
worst martini ever 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
good product good seller 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
but i dont like it 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
check it out 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
it is an insane game 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
sending it back 0 
the management is rude 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
nice ambiance 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
poor reliability 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
service stinks here 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
does not fit 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
great product for the price 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the design is very good4 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
too politically correct 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
great phone 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
horrible phone 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
would not reccommend 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
eclectic selection 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
great service and food 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
they were excellent 1 
i really liked that 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the food is good 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
cumbersome design 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
warning stay away 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
love this phone 1 
the acting was bad 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
id like to return it 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
1010 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
its very slow 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
why was this film made 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
overall a great experience 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i paid too much 0 
works well 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
hated it 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
these are fabulous 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
very poor service 0 
well im satisfied 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
very disappointing 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i waited and waited 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
does not work 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
go watch it 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
worst martini ever 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
great price also 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
everything was gross 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
omit watching this 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the food amazing 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
great audio 1 
dont waste your time 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
good price 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
how awful she is 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
not worth it 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
and it was boring 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
painful on the ear 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
sooooo good 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
what a waste of time 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
gets the job done 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i will not return 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
brilliant 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
good value great food great service 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
that was funny 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
it was so boring 0 
good show samsung 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
good item low price 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it was so boring 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this place is great 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
works for me 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
they were excellent 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
this phone works great 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i really liked that 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the cast is good 1 
terrible service 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
made very sturdy 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i love this place 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
its just painful 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i love this thing 1 
love this headset 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
would not go back 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
im super pissd 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
everything was gross 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i would recommend this 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
very poor service 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
krussel always good 1 
its pretty easy 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
poor quality and service 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
dont waste your money 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
love this phone 1 
very disappointing 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
left very frustrated 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
sooooo good 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
very disappointing 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
very disappointing 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
fast service 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
cumbersome design 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
very prompt service 1 
item does not match picture 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the food was very good 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
will not be back 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
id love to go back 1 
these are fabulous 1 
good price 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
bad purchase 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
portable and it works 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
its really easy 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
dont waste your money 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
never going back 0 
poor reliability 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
i waited and waited 0 
very bad experience 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
it was awesome 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
great audio 1 
this place lacked style 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
yes its that bad 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
awful service 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
nothing new there 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
would not go back 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
check it out 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
dont waste your money 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
it was not good 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it was so boring 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
very disappointing 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
there is no real plot 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
this case seems well made 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
love this headset 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
very easy to use 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
portable and it works 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
1010 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
omit watching this 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
a good time 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
hated it 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i consider this theft 0 
owners are really great people 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i am very happy 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
overall a great experience 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
go rent it 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1
