the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
disapointing results 0 
does not fit 0 
over rated 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i paid too much 0 
very friendly staff 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
well im satisfied 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
so far so good 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
works great 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
will order from them again 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
nice leather 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
service is also cute 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
what a waste 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
great audio 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
a great touch 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
its very slow 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
doesnt last long 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not recommended 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
great hands free device 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
great product and price 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
lousy product 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
stay away from the q 0 
poor sound quality 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
would not go back 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
bad choice 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
is pretty funny 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
sending it back 0 
very comfortable 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i love this place 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
totally believable 1 
1010 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
50 down the drain 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
disappointing 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it was horrible 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
give this one a look 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
not my thing 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
its aggravating 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
good transmit audio 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
battery has no life 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
they were excellent 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
works great 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
left very frustrated 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
great service and food 1 
krussel always good 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
will never ever go back 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
it is not good 0 
absolutely great 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
its very slow 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
waste of money 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
warning do not buy 0 
this pda rocks 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
cumbersome design 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
great movie 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it was horrible 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
we loved the place 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
love this phone 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
great phone 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
buttons are too small 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
waitress was good though 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
it was horrible 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
great audio 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this place is good 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
what a mistake 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
service is also cute 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
works good 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
too politically correct 0 
horrible phone 0 
owners are really great people 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
you wont regret it 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
a good time 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
defective crap 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
service sucks 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
no real improvement 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
love this phone 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
disapointing results 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
did not like at all 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
excellent product 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
great bluetooth 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is a great phone 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
really good product 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
dont buy it 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
would recommend this item 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i paid too much 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
has been working great 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
great phone 1 
how awesome is that 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
disapointing results 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
do not waste your time 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
extremely tasty 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
give this one a look 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
again no plot at all 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
how awesome is that 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
great for ipods too 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
made very sturdy 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
good audio quality 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
good prices 1 
lousy product 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
very funny 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
kind of flops around 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it is shameful 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
bad choice 0 
everything stinks 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
excellent 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the food is good 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
terrible management 0 
the cast was great 1 
battery life is also great 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
made very sturdy 1 
everything was gross 0 
lousy product 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
not what i wanted 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this case seems well made 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
better than new 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
horrible phone 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
omit watching this 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this is infuriating 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the poor actors 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
good item low price 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
great price too 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
well never go again 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
terrible management 0 
no complaints 1 
i will not return 0 
really bad 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
bad reception 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the portion was huge 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this pda rocks 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not recommended 0 
that was nice 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
just does not work 0 
they are so cool 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
awsome device works great 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
low quality 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
we loved the place 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
1010 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
dont do it 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
they were excellent 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
poor reliability 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
absolutely great 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
better than expected 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
its very slow 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
it looks very nice 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it is a true classic 1 
why was this film made 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
warning do not buy 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
yes its that bad 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it works 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
poor reliability 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
lousy product 0 
so just beware 0 
mediocre food 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
we wont be going back 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
worked great 1 
overall a great experience 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
very prompt service 1 
i was so insulted 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
soggy and not good 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
battery life is also great 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
really ugly 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this is infuriating 0 
why was this film made 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
excellent 1 
this is a great deal 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
we loved the place 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
highly recommended a 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
better than expected 1 
no real improvement 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
excellent product for the price 1
