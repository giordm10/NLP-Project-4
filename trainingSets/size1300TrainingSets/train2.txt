great pizza and salads 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
its just lame 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
go watch it 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
awesome service and food 1 
works fine 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i wont be back 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
great price too 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
magical help 1 
i think not again 0 
very disappointing 0 
what a disappointment 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
nice leather 1 
very disappointing 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
not enough volume 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
bad choice 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
wasted two hours 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
very very fun chef 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
but i dont like it 0 
excellent 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it was a great phone 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
both great 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
sending it back 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this is a great deal 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
that company is a joke 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
design flaw 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
youll love it 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the best phone in market 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
great product and price 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
would not reccommend 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
and it was boring 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
great movie 1 
good case 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
great brunch spot 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
great phone 1 
great phone 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the film is way too long 0 
not easy to watch 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
worthless product 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
bad reception 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
very friendly staff 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
poor reliability 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
kind of flops around 0 
very prompt service 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i love it 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
this game rocks 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
good food good service 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i paid too much 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it was delicious 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
krussel always good 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
great product 1 
great price also 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the best phone in market 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
good value great food great service 1 
not easy to watch 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
these are fabulous 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
im not eating here 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
it was way over fried 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
great audio 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
this is a great little item 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this game rocks 1 
was not happy 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
but i dont like it 0 
great value 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
warning stay away 0 
great value 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
great movie 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
works great 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
good audio quality 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
excellent 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
waste of money 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
really good product 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i wont be back 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
will not be back 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
you cant beat that 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
worst customer service 0 
worst phone ever 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
service stinks here 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
battery is terrible 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
horrible phone 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
very good product well made 1 
the best phone in market 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
easy to use 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
does not fit 0 
love it great armband 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
both great 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
its just painful 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
waitress was good though 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
so they performed 1 
will not be back 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
excellent short film 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
good show samsung 1 
and it was boring 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the food is good 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
easy to use 1 
works great 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
really ugly 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
very good quality though 1 
dont buy it 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
great movie 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
you cant beat that 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
so bad 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
fast service 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
dont waste your time 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
dont buy it 0 
it is shameful 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
works great 1 
sending it back 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
would not go back 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
good item low price 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
absolutely great 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
very good quality though 1 
great product 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
kind of flops around 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
excellent short film 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
well never go again 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
good audio quality 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
painful on the ear 0 
good product good seller 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
poor product 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
very prompt service 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
dont buy this product 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
used and dirty 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
extremely tasty 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it was packed 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
simply beautiful 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
check it out 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
horrible phone 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
what a disappointment 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
great movie 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
absolutel junk 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
so they performed 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the problem was the script 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
great service and food 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
worthless product 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
wont go back 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
both great 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this place lacked style 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
great audio 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
overall a great experience 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great choice 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
crisp and clear 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i consider this theft 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
totally believable 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
battery has no life 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
her role was played well 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
awsome device works great 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this is a great deal 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
worked perfectly 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
buttons are too small 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
damn good steak 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
you wont regret it 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
it was horrible 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
her role was played well 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
go and see it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
works great 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
worst customer service 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it was delicious 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
very comfortable 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great for ipods too 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
very comfortable 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
how awful she is 0 
excellent service 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
awesome service and food 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
brilliant 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i never come again 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i love it 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
just does not work 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
not enough volume 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i will not return 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
totally believable 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
not my thing 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the food was very good 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
see both films if you can 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
good works fine 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
piece of trash 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
magical help 1 
i loved it 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i will not return 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
50 down the drain 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
waste of money 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
very funny 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0
