all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
happy so far 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
low quality 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
warning stay away 0 
awesome service and food 1 
service is also cute 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
horrible 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
too politically correct 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
owners are really great people 1 
will definitely be back 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
over rated 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
great phone 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
too politically correct 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
battery has no life 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
great price too 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
bad reception 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
works for me 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
my order was not correct 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
terrible management 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
battery life is real good 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
very disappointing 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
dont buy it 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
horrible 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
will not be back 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
has been working great 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
it was so boring 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
total waste of time 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i love this device 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the acting was bad 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
gets the job done 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
not recommended 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
just does not work 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
made very sturdy 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
so far so good 1 
gets the job done 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
worst ever 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
i love this device 1 
bad purchase 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
we loved the place 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
battery life is real good 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
awful service 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
terrible service 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
but i dont like it 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
its just painful 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
check it out 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
worst ever 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
everything was gross 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
nothing special 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
wow loved this place 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
it was horrible 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i heart this place 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this game rocks 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
bad quality 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
worth every penny 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
its not user friendly 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
disappointing experience 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
totally believable 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it is not good 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
very good quality though 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
price is good too 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the design is very good4 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
so just beware 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
its not user friendly 0 
yes its that bad 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i am very happy 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
great case and price 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
very happy with this product 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
poor sound quality 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
piece of trash 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the best phone in market 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
works well 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
they were excellent 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
love this phone 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this is a great deal 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i waited and waited 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the acting was bad 0 
there is no real plot 0 
great product and price 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
it was horrible 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
great price also 1 
see it 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
it was packed 0 
it was delicious 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the food is good 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
doesnt last long 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
this pda rocks 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
awsome device works great 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
five star plus plus 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
disappointing 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
works for me 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the acting was bad 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
mediocre food 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
easy to use 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it is shameful 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
good audio quality 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
works great 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
not easy to watch 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
will definitely be back 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
would not go back 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
dont buy this product 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
great audio 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
excellent service 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
better than expected 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
works as described 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
has been working great 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
good product good seller 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
they were excellent 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i am very happy 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
owners are really great people 1 
this is infuriating 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
better than expected 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
id love to go back 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
do not waste your time 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
great phone 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
good prices 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the service was meh 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
see it 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
its aggravating 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
defective crap 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
we loved the place 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
it was not good 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
food was really boring 0 
an hour seriously 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
dont go here 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it is not good 0 
battery has no life 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
wont go back 0 
totally believable 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
it was packed 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
very easy to use 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
low quality 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the cast was great 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
great price also 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
not recommended 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
good prices 1 
very disappointing 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
you cant beat that 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it was not good 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this movie is bad 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i love this thing 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i love this place 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
great phone 1 
does not work 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
he was terrible 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
simply beautiful 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
great phone 1 
nothing special 0 
see both films if you can 1 
great product for the price 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
nice ambiance 1 
happy so far 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
i would recommend this 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
it was not good 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
terrible management 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
would not reccommend 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
worth every penny 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it is an insane game 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
great audio 1 
overall a delight 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0
