i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
im returning them 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
disappointed 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
will be back again 1 
this is a great deal 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
did not like at all 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
nice leather 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
well im satisfied 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
doesnt last long 0 
what a mistake 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
omit watching this 0 
i consider this theft 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
good product good seller 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
absolutel junk 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
it was packed 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
better than expected 1 
krussel always good 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
good value great food great service 1 
cumbersome design 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
works for me 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
a standout scene 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
disapointing results 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
best headset ever 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
very disappointed 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
horrible phone 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
not impressed 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
great hands free device 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i heart this place 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
very disappointed 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
poor product 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
too politically correct 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
how awful she is 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
everything stinks 0 
you wont regret it 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
great hands free device 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
great product for the price 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
doesnt work 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
works as described 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
really awful 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
great phone 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
not recommended 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i think not again 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
everything stinks 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
painful on the ear 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
magical help 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
very comfortable 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the cast was great 1 
works for me 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
very disappointed 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
over rated 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
great choice 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
fantastic service here 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
very very fun chef 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
they were excellent 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it was not good 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the acting was bad 0 
better than youd expect 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
im super pissd 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
i was mortified 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
poor reliability 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
very easy to use 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
works for me 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the acting sucked 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
it was horrendous 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
owners are really great people 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i think not again 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
go watch it 1 
very easy to use 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
it was horrible 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
really bad 0 
i am very happy 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
cool phone 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
what a mistake 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
an hour seriously 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
mediocre food 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
eclectic selection 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
portable and it works 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
they are so cool 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
mediocre food 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
very good product well made 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
that was nice 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
service was very prompt 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
awesome device 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
waitress was good though 1 
battery life is also great 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
great case and price 1 
we loved the place 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
everything stinks 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
service was very prompt 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i was so insulted 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
everything was gross 0 
1010 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the phone loads super 1 
worthless product 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
it worked very well 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i heart this place 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
works as described 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
that was funny 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
bad reception 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
worth every penny 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
that movie was bad 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
we wont be returning 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
go rent it 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
very disappointing 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
battery life is also great 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
does not fit 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
good transmit audio 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it was packed 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
great service and food 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
why was this film made 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
great product for the price 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
fantastic service here 1 
they have great dinners 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i would recommend it 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
everything stinks 0 
better than new 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the food was terrible 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
good audio quality 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
very disappointing 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
over rated 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
poor sound quality 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the food was very good 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
stay away from the q 0 
again no plot at all 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
not good for the money 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
its really easy 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
very comfortable 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
doesnt last long 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
again lame 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
great movie 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
and it was boring 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
a standout scene 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i love it 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
good value great food great service 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
wasted two hours 0 
disappointing 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the food is good 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
damn good steak 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
worst customer service 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
very disappointing 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this is a great deal 1 
great phone 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i loved it 1 
very windresistant 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
food was really boring 0 
buttons are too small 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
awesome service and food 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
not recommended 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
battery life is real good 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
very disappointing 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
better than youd expect 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
fast service 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
last time buying from you 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
poor reliability 0 
happy so far 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
great phone 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
this place has it 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
mediocre food 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
worst customer service 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
nice sound 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
simply beautiful 1 
really bad 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
disappointing experience 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it was delicious 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i consider this theft 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this phone works great 1 
the battery works great 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
what a waste 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the food is good 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
her role was played well 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this game rocks 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the acting was bad 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
disappointed 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
total brunch fail 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1
