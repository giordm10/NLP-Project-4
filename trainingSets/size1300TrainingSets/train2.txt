brilliance indeed 1 
great product for the price 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
omit watching this 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
service stinks here 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the battery works great 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
just what i wanted 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
how stupid is that 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
used and dirty 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
nice design and quality 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
it was equally awful 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
awesome service and food 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
bad reception 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
poor reliability 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
no complaints 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
excellent product 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the food was very good 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
omit watching this 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
either way it sucks 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
disappointed 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i think not again 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
nothing special 0 
good audio quality 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
check it out 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
very prompt service 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
very prompt service 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i think not again 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it is shameful 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i want my money back 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
very funny 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
poor product 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
do not waste your time 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
they are so cool 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
totally believable 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this is a great deal 1 
gets the job done 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
good product incredible value 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
very funny 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this is a great deal 1 
good show samsung 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
very prompt service 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
this is a great phone 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
what a waste 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
not good for the money 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
great product and price 1 
terrible management 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
good food good service 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
very disappointing 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
great product and price 1 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
so bad 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
buttons are too small 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
everything was gross 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
total waste of time 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
works well 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
great price too 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
so they performed 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
worked perfectly 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
good item low price 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
these are fabulous 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
so far so good 1 
better than expected 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
again lame 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
lousy product 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the cast was great 1 
it was awesome 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
worst customer service 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
not worth it 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
im pleased 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
it is shameful 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
piece of junk 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i wont be back 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
omit watching this 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
over rated 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the problem was the script 0 
disappointed 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the battery works great 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
better than expected 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
really bad 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
this place has it 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
amazon sucks 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
excellent product 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the best phone in market 1 
very disappointing 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
incredible 1 
five star plus plus 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
horrible phone 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i love this place 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
highly recommended 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
this place lacked style 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the fries were great too 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i wont be back 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
item does not match picture 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
great phone 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
krussel always good 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the phone loads super 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
very prompt service 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
good food good service 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
worst customer service 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
sweetest phone 1 
id like to return it 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
does not work 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this place lacked style 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
we are sending it back 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
highly recommended 1 
love this phone 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it was so boring 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
dont buy it 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
that movie was bad 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
this is a great phone 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
not recommended 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
why was this film made 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
not good for the money 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
awesome device 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
this place lacked style 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
works good 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
dont buy this product 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
fantastic service here 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i waited and waited 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
great case and price 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
worst thai ever 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
really bad 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
how stupid is that 0 
just does not work 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
nothing new there 0 
so far so good 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
good servicecheck 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
this pda rocks 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
doesnt last long 0 
love this phone 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
terrible management 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
great choice 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
lets start with all the problemsÂ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
good servicecheck 1 
great product and price 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
works well 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
works fine 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the acting sucked 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this is a good joint 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
what a waste 0 
i love this place 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this is a good joint 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
dont waste your money 0 
very disappointed 0 
very very sad 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
1010 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
good case 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
works great 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
works great 1 
great product 1 
horrible 0 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i paid too much 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
very poor service 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
works for me 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
works fine 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0
