i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
bad choice 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
did not like at all 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this place has it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
great phone 1 
fast service 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
very funny 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it was horrible 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i love this thing 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
very good quality though 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
will order from them again 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
worst thai ever 0 
1010 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
go rent it 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
awful service 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
a great touch 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
disappointed 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
great price too 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
warning stay away 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
really good product 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
horrible phone 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the film is way too long 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i was so insulted 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
fast service 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
good works fine 1 
disapointing results 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
good show samsung 1 
wasted two hours 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
not easy to watch 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this place is good 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i think not again 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
so far so good 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
its really easy 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the cast is good 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
very disappointing 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
does not fit 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
its a great item 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
excellent phone 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
im pleased 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i love this place 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
will not be back 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
great food 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
wow loved this place 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
how stupid is that 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
a pretty good product 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
so bad 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
damn good steak 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
wow loved this place 1 
im returning them 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
again lame 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
again no plot at all 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
bad purchase 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
poor quality 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
good case 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
again no plot at all 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
great product 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
total brunch fail 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
this pda rocks 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
price is good too 1 
i love it 1 
bad purchase 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it was so cool 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
dont buy it 0 
i love it 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
nice ambiance 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i loved it 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it was horrendous 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
excellent phone 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
good prices 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
bad quality 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it was horrible 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
this place is amazing 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
bad choice 0 
works good 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
made very sturdy 1 
im not eating here 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it was horrendous 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
has been working great 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
would not reccommend 0 
food was average at best 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
either way it sucks 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
food was below average 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
service was fantastic 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
omit watching this 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
it was so cool 1 
great audio 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
food was average at best 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i will not return 0 
interesting decor 1 
it was not good 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
its pretty easy 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
great product for the price 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is a great phone 1 
waitress was good though 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
incredible 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
horrible phone 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i liked it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
it was equally awful 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it works 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
was not happy 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
really awful 0 
not my thing 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
very windresistant 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
piece of junk 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it was so cool 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the battery works great 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
they are so cool 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
that company is a joke 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
good price 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
service was very prompt 1 
battery life is real good 1 
great price too 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
awful 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the phone loads super 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it is not good 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
was not happy 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
id love to go back 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
how awesome is that 1 
last time buying from you 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
love this phone 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
battery is terrible 0 
how awesome is that 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
i will not return 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
left very frustrated 0 
works good 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
very funny 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
very disappointing 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
just does not work 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
how awesome is that 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
my order was not correct 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
good value great food great service 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i will not return 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
both great 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the fries were great too 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
omit watching this 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i would recommend it 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the management is rude 0 
works great 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
im pleased 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this case seems well made 1 
excellent performance 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
price is good too 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
service is also cute 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
extremely tasty 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
youll love it 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it was awesome 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it is not good 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it worked very well 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
very good though 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i was mortified 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
does not fit 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
poor quality and service 0 
did not like at all 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i was mortified 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
great service and food 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i love this thing 1 
disappointed 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
worst thai ever 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
they have great dinners 1 
not impressed 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
again no plot at all 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
disappointed 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
very comfortable 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
not easy to watch 0 
nothing new there 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
magical help 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
crust is not good 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this case seems well made 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
poor product 0 
how awful she is 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
definitely a bargain 1
