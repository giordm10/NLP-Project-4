interesting decor 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
con spotty service 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
low quality 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
everything was gross 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i wont be back 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
works good 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i love this place 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
really awful 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
the portion was huge 1 
why was this film made 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
good product good seller 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
give this one a look 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
that was nice 1 
lousy product 0 
no complaints 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
disappointed 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
this phone works great 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
food was really boring 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
so they performed 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
how awful she is 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the cast was great 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
worthless product 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i heart this place 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the food was terrible 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
will not be back 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
food was really boring 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
five star plus plus 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
that company is a joke 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
the food is good 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this place is amazing 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
terrible service 0 
very happy with this product 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i love this place 1 
good quality 1 
i never come again 0 
the acting sucked 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it was awesome 1 
very disappointing 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
hated it 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
it worked very well 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great phone 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
last time buying from you 0 
just what i wanted 1 
you cant beat that 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
that was nice 1 
highly recommended 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
good price 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
great price also 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
good audio quality 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
its just lame 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the poor actors 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
not recommended 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
nice ambiance 1 
disappointed 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
this phone works great 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
very disappointed 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
they are so cool 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
no real improvement 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
worst thai ever 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it is shameful 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i wont be back 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
works great 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
really good product 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
great price also 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the food amazing 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
a pretty good product 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
worthless product 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i love it 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it was horrendous 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
dont buy it 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
its just lame 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
go watch it 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it was way over fried 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
love it great armband 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
would not reccommend 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
crust is not good 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
im super pissd 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
great movie 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the portion was huge 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
will be back again 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
interesting decor 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
mediocre food 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
that was nice 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
great brunch spot 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it was so funny 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
simply beautiful 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
dont go here 0 
it was so cool 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
very easy to use 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
a standout scene 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
will not be back 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
will definitely be back 1 
check it out 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
a bit predictable 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
defective crap 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
dont do it 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
really bad 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the cast is good 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great phone 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
terrible service 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i love it 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
fast service 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
very disappointing 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
nothing special 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
great brunch spot 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
bad purchase 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
is pretty funny 1 
its aggravating 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
incredible 1 
good audio quality 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
id like to return it 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
truly awful 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
not recommended 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
battery life is real good 1 
what a waste 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
im super pissd 0 
very disappointing 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
its a total package 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i think not again 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its just painful 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
im super pissd 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
worst martini ever 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
a great touch 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
extremely tasty 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it was horrendous 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
dont miss it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
very bad experience 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
go rent it 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
that company is a joke 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
great movie 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
dont buy it 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
has been working great 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
good case 1 
battery life is real good 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
five star plus plus 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
used and dirty 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
dont waste your money 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
stay away from the q 0 
great product 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
absolutel junk 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
so they performed 1 
not good for the money 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
very very sad 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
nice sound 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
very disappointed 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
excellent performance 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
that company is a joke 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
they are so cool 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
left very frustrated 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
good price 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the acting was bad 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
awful 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
dont buy this product 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i love this device 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
50 down the drain 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
a disappointment 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i love this device 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1
