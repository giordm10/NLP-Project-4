its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
so just beware 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
there is no real plot 0 
dont waste your money 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the food is good 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
better than new 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
works for me 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
nothing new there 0 
very very sad 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
better than new 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this place has it 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
fantastic food 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
very bad experience 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
it was equally awful 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
dont go here 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i will not return 0 
youll love it 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
disappointing 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its a great item 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
youll love it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
battery life is real good 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
horrible phone 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
extremely tasty 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
worst ever 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
works as described 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
its not user friendly 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
cool phone 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
excellent phone 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
her role was played well 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
disapointing results 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
very easy to use 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
im not eating here 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
better than youd expect 1 
good product incredible value 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
fantastic food 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
youll love it 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
was not happy 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
check it out 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
damn good steak 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
service was very prompt 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the acting was bad 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i loved it 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
very disappointing 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
great product 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
works great 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
1010 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
worst customer service 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
love this product 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
great earpiece 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
soggy and not good 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
go watch it 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
waste of money 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the food amazing 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
id love to go back 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
nothing new there 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
horrible phone 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it just blew 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
owners are really great people 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
brilliant 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
good product incredible value 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
very disappointed 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
terrible management 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
how stupid is that 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
dont go here 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
warning stay away 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
good case excellent value 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
great choice 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
great phone 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i love this device 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
id love to go back 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
worked great 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
krussel always good 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it was so cool 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
poor reliability 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
doesnt work 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
yes its that bad 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
just does not work 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
better than youd expect 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
great price also 1 
i am very happy 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
service sucks 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
very displeased 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
never got it 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
over rated 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
last time buying from you 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
these are fabulous 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
not easy to watch 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
worst thai ever 0 
very disappointing 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
worked perfectly 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
its not user friendly 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
kind of flops around 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
it was delicious 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the block was amazing 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
highly recommended 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
better than new 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the fries were great too 1 
im pleased 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
so they performed 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i was so insulted 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
incredible 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
awful 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i love this device 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
great audio 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
great phone 1 
con spotty service 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
great product 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
great product and price 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
nice ambiance 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
you cant beat that 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
worst thai ever 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
very very sad 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
excellent 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
poor product 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i love it 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
nice leather 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
disapointing results 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
awful service 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
overall a delight 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
happy so far 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
a good time 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
very good though 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
omit watching this 0 
very displeased 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
no real improvement 0 
hated it 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
too politically correct 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
poor quality 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great phone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
worst customer service 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
good food good service 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
highly recommended 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
will be back again 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
soggy and not good 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
great for ipods too 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
how awful she is 0 
nice design and quality 1 
both great 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the cast is good 1 
good item low price 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
im not eating here 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it was way over fried 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this game rocks 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i paid too much 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
very prompt service 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
defective crap 0 
i wont be back 0 
we wont be going back 0 
dont waste your money 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
her role was played well 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
nice leather 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
is pretty funny 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
not worth it 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
very happy with this product 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
does not work 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
a great touch 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
dont waste your money 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
everything was gross 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it looks very nice 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
what a waste 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
food was really boring 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i love this place 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
everything stinks 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1
