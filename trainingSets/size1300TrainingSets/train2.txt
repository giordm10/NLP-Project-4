worthless product 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
the poor actors 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
awsome device works great 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
nice sound 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
50 down the drain 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great value 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
cumbersome design 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
terrible service 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
it looks very nice 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
works good 1 
incredible 1 
the design is very good4 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
very happy with this product 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
1010 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
love this headset 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
battery life is also great 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
im not eating here 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it is a true classic 1 
good quality 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it is an insane game 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
works great 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
this is a great phone 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
service was very prompt 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
great audio 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
great phone 1 
good product incredible value 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
a good time 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
piece of junk 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
its just painful 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
very funny 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it looks very nice 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
works as described 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its a great item 1 
bad quality 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
this is a great phone 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
very good quality though 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
overall a delight 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
piece of trash 0 
really awful 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the cast is good 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the acting was bad 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
good value great food great service 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
wow loved this place 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the cast was great 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
you wont regret it 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
great sound and service 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
not a good bargain 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
very good quality though 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
good prices 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
but i dont like it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it is a true classic 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
battery is terrible 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
portable and it works 1 
good prices 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i really liked that 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
lousy product 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
kind of flops around 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
im returning them 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
it is not good 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
works great 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
a good time 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
better than youd expect 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
good case 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
love this phone 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
does not fit 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
a good time 1 
the service was meh 0 
1010 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
will not be back 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
good quality 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
better than new 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i love this thing 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
painful on the ear 0 
used and dirty 0 
worst thai ever 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
poor quality 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
love this product 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
very good though 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
this place lacked style 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
doesnt last long 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
works for me 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
excellent 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
good audio quality 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
damn good steak 1 
poor product 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
not impressed 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i love this place 1 
good case excellent value 1 
great food 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i love this device 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
does not work 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i really liked that 1 
good product good seller 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the service was meh 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
good item low price 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the food amazing 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
wasted two hours 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
it was horrible 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it looks very nice 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
nice leather 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
it was horrible 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it was awesome 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
dont go here 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
food was delicious 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
great service and food 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
great service and food 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
incredible 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
great value 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
wow loved this place 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i paid too much 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this phone works great 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
great product and price 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this is a great deal 1 
see both films if you can 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
very good though 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
it is a true classic 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
poor quality 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
works good 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
krussel always good 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the food was terrible 0 
service stinks here 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
bad choice 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
that company is a joke 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
very good though 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it is not good 0 
not recommended 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
it is not good 0 
food was average at best 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
never got it 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
good transmit audio 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
why was this film made 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
crust is not good 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
food was delicious 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
very prompt service 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this is a great phone 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
poor product 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
very disappointed 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
battery has no life 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
well never go again 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
great choice 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
used and dirty 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
low quality 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
price is good too 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
it was equally awful 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
not a good bargain 0 
soggy and not good 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
poor quality 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
love it great armband 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
you wont regret it 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i would recommend it 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
really awful 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i love this place 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the acting was bad 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
we wont be returning 0 
this phone works great 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
best headset ever 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
an hour seriously 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
portable and it works 1 
i loved it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
does not fit 0 
fantastic service here 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i waited and waited 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
terrible management 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
disapointing results 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
why was this film made 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it was not good 0 
the poor actors 0 
so they performed 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
omit watching this 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
1010 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
sweetest phone 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
great product for the price 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
item does not match picture 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
it was way over fried 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
poor quality 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1
