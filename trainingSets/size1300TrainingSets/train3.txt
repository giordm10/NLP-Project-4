i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
what a mistake 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
not recommended 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
a great touch 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
but its just not funny 0 
its aggravating 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
good value great food great service 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
dont do it 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
hated it 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
not easy to watch 0 
great service and food 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
never got it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
totally believable 1 
good prices 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this place is great 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
you wont regret it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
never got it 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
will be back again 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
sweetest phone 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it is a true classic 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
works great 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i love this phone 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i will not return 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the cast is good 1 
totally believable 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
love this headset 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
poor quality 0 
im super pissd 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
poor construction 0 
great earpiece 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
food was really boring 0 
excellent product 1 
very good product well made 1 
nothing new there 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i was mortified 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great value 1 
its very slow 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
good product good seller 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
nice sound 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the film is way too long 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
really bad 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
great for ipods too 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the cast is good 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
poor reliability 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
buttons are too small 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
my order was not correct 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
damn good steak 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it was so funny 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
everything stinks 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
food was average at best 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
service was fantastic 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
a disappointment 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
we loved the place 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
a good time 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i want my money back 0 
works as described 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i liked it 1 
a pretty good product 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this movie is bad 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will not be back 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i would recommend this 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
that company is a joke 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the food was terrible 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
worst thai ever 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
very disappointing 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
price is good too 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
what a waste of time 0 
con spotty service 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
too politically correct 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
stay away from the q 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
a bit predictable 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
it just blew 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
battery life is also great 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
highly recommended 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
total waste of time 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
her role was played well 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
kind of flops around 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the food was terrible 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
really awful 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
a standout scene 1 
very good product well made 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
nice ambiance 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
so just beware 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
piece of trash 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the portion was huge 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
works fine 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
this place lacked style 0 
everything is appalling 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
very disappointing 0 
battery is terrible 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the film is way too long 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
very good though 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
will not be back 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this game rocks 1 
great earpiece 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
good case 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
and it was boring 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
not enough volume 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
great for ipods too 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it just blew 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
painful on the ear 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
good value great food great service 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
very happy with this product 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
absolutely great 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
service stinks here 0 
we wont be going back 0 
excellent 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
we wont be returning 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
excellent product 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it is a true classic 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this case seems well made 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
service sucks 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
will never ever go back 0 
great charger 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i love it 1 
love it great armband 1 
horrible 0 
amazon sucks 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
battery has no life 0 
worth every penny 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i am very happy 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
dont do it 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
better than new 1 
everything stinks 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
better than youd expect 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
very good though 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
this is a great deal 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
dont buy it 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
everything was gross 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
dont waste your money 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
owners are really great people 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
terrible management 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the acting was bad 0 
soggy and not good 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the food was terrible 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
good food good service 1 
good case excellent value 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
dont go here 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it was so funny 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
service was fantastic 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
great service and food 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
worth every penny 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
it is a true classic 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
does not work 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
its pretty easy 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i am very happy 1 
very disappointing 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
magical help 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
you cant beat that 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
great product and price 1 
would not reccommend 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i liked it 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
that was nice 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
was not happy 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
will not be back 0 
works as described 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
no real improvement 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1

logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
dont buy it 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
very good though 1 
i think not again 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
service sucks 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it was equally awful 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
very windresistant 1 
food was average at best 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
excellent 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it was horrible 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
not impressed 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the block was amazing 1 
highly recommended 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
what a waste of time 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
service is also cute 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
food was average at best 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
food was delicious 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
nice leather 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
everything was gross 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
well im satisfied 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
nothing new there 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
food was really boring 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
so far so good 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the food was terrible 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
sweetest phone 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
service was very prompt 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
will not be back 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
fast service 1 
service stinks here 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
fantastic food 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
excellent product 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
sending it back 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
love this headset 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
stay away from the q 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i would recommend this 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
kind of flops around 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
love this headset 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
will not be back 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
they were excellent 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
so far so good 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the block was amazing 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
poor construction 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
brilliant 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i loved it 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this game rocks 1 
go rent it 1 
would not reccommend 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
will definitely be back 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1
