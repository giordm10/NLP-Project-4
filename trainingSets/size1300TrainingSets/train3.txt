the food is good 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
very disappointing 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i think not again 0 
very comfortable 1 
the food is good 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
sending it back 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
great price too 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
better than expected 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
lousy product 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
it was so cool 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
owners are really great people 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
poor product 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the food is good 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this is infuriating 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
so bad 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
highly recommended 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the portion was huge 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
totally believable 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
simply beautiful 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the fries were great too 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
did not like at all 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
gets the job done 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the phone loads super 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
50 down the drain 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
not impressed 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
what a waste 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
dont waste your money 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
my order was not correct 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
very disappointing 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
very very fun chef 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
love this product 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i would recommend it 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
good product incredible value 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
works good 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
service was very prompt 1 
will not be back 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
best headset ever 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
would not go back 0 
battery life is real good 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i love this device 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the cast was great 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the poor actors 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
it is shameful 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i heart this place 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
very very fun chef 1 
very easy to use 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
highly recommended 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
will order from them again 1 
i consider this theft 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
battery life is real good 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
fast service 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
they have great dinners 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
good product good seller 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this is a great phone 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
awful 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
so bad 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
well im satisfied 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
1010 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
do not waste your time 0 
will definitely be back 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i never come again 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
this is infuriating 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
it just blew 0 
not good for the money 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
very good phone 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
absolutely great 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
again no plot at all 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
well never go again 0 
love this phone 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
bad purchase 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
its just painful 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
great for ipods too 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
service stinks here 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
portable and it works 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
service stinks here 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
brilliant 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
simply beautiful 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i love this device 1 
i paid too much 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
it worked very well 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
very displeased 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
works great 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i liked it 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
worst ever 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
very friendly staff 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
worked great 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
worst ever 0 
service was very prompt 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
so far so good 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
yes its that bad 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
good case 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i was so insulted 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
worthwhile 1 
really bad 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
it was horrible 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
con spotty service 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
this is a great little item 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i love it 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
hated it 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
very comfortable 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
very disappointing 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
will not be back 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
over rated 0 
battery life is real good 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
poor product 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
nice leather 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
so they performed 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
awsome device works great 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
good case 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the portion was huge 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
great value 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i love this place 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
both great 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
bad reception 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i think not again 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
the best phone in market 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
great choice 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
will not be back 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
best headset ever 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
just does not work 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
go watch it 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
left very frustrated 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
extremely tasty 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i love it 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
very poor service 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
too politically correct 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it is not good 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
what a waste of time 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
what a disappointment 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
will not be back 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
excellent short film 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
krussel always good 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
bad reception 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the block was amazing 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
poor construction 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
great brunch spot 1 
love it great armband 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i consider this theft 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
would not go back 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
incredible 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the food was terrible 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
see it 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
good price 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
works good 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
fantastic food 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
we wont be returning 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
go and see it 1 
incredible 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
poor sound quality 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
this phone works great 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1
