the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
made very sturdy 1 
cumbersome design 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
bad choice 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
highly recommended a 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i will not return 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
great for ipods too 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
excellent short film 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
works great 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
wont go back 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
bad reception 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
there is no real plot 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
design flaw 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
good product good seller 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
great sound and service 1 
works fine 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
highly recommended a 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the design is very good4 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
it just blew 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
good works fine 1 
i love this place 1 
her role was played well 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
not good for the money 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
does not fit 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
no real improvement 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
works well 1 
a standout scene 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
an hour seriously 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
really bad 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the food is good 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
easy to use 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
great value 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
excellent short film 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this place is amazing 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
would recommend this item 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
lousy product 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
how awesome is that 1 
never going back 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the cast is good 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
really awful 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this place is good 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
great phone 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
delicious 1 
battery has no life 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
battery is terrible 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
overall a great experience 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
awesome service and food 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its really easy 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
disapointing results 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
happy so far 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the best phone in market 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
very good though 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
works as described 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this case seems well made 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
service sucks 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
fast service 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
magical help 1 
great product 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
very windresistant 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
battery life is real good 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
well never go again 0 
an hour seriously 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i was so insulted 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
will be back again 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i wont be back 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
very very fun chef 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the acting sucked 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
incredible 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
would not reccommend 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it was so cool 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
go watch it 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the poor actors 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
an hour seriously 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this place is amazing 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
absolutel junk 0 
awesome device 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
kind of flops around 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
absolutel junk 0 
its pretty easy 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
stay away from the q 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
awesome device 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
excellent service 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
warning do not buy 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
it just blew 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
its just painful 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
great product 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this case seems well made 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
truly awful 0 
did not like at all 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
service was very prompt 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
piece of trash 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
very comfortable 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
that was nice 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
excellent short film 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
fast service 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
works great 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
nice leather 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
mediocre food 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
this pda rocks 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
its pretty easy 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
doesnt last long 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
never got it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
it looks very nice 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
great charger 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the film is way too long 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this case seems well made 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
battery life is real good 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
how awesome is that 1 
great food 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the food amazing 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
dont do it 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
it worked very well 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
disappointed 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
service is also cute 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
it was so cool 1 
works as described 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very poor service 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
overall a delight 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
overall a great experience 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
works fine 1 
doesnt last long 0 
not easy to watch 0 
waitress was good though 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
the poor actors 0 
it was so funny 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
this phone works great 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
so far so good 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
service sucks 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
but its just not funny 0 
never going back 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
interesting decor 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
awful service 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
its very slow 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
how stupid is that 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
magical help 1 
not recommended 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
really awful 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the cast was great 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the acting was bad 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
fantastic service here 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
poor construction 0 
highly recommended 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
damn good steak 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
awful 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the poor actors 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
works for me 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i am very happy 1 
dont buy this product 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
sooooo good 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the management is rude 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its just lame 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
dont buy this product 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
a good time 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
design flaw 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
fantastic service here 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
will order from them again 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
disappointing experience 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
damn good steak 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
everything stinks 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is a good joint 1 
overall a delight 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
dont do it 0 
absolutel junk 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
they are so cool 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i love this phone 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
works as described 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i want my money back 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
again lame 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
works well 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the cast is good 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
why was this film made 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
nice design and quality 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
warning stay away 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
poor product 0 
will not be back 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
item does not match picture 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
awful 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
good audio quality 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
im returning them 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
great value 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0
