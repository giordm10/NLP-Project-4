the results well are a shame 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
very happy with this product 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
wow loved this place 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this is a great little item 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
buttons are too small 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
very disappointing 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
not recommended 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
terrible management 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i really liked that 1 
over rated 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
good works fine 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
excellent 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
eclectic selection 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
works fine 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
excellent performance 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
awsome device works great 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the food was very good 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
it was horrendous 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
well never go again 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
just does not work 0 
overall a delight 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i heart this place 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
better than youd expect 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
great product for the price 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
excellent performance 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
poor product 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
does not fit 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
you cant beat that 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
it just blew 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
truly awful 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
used and dirty 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
terrible service 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
great food 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
dont miss it 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it works 1 
id like to return it 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
horrible phone 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
will never ever go back 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
totally believable 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the acting was bad 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
works as described 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
id love to go back 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
well im satisfied 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
worthless product 0 
i was mortified 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
terrible service 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
extremely tasty 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
very prompt service 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
lousy product 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
not easy to watch 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
great hands free device 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i wont be back 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
sooooo good 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
better than expected 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i was so insulted 0 
fast service 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
works great 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
great product for the price 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
poor quality 0 
poor product 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
incredible 1 
horrible phone 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
dont waste your time 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
so they performed 1 
dont miss it 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the food amazing 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
does not work 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
low quality 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
disappointing 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
good show samsung 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
great service and food 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
again lame 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
terrible management 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
bad choice 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it was delicious 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
a great touch 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
very windresistant 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
piece of junk 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
great value 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
just what i wanted 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
service was fantastic 1 
disappointed 0 
dont go here 0 
i consider this theft 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
sooooo good 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i wont be back 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
we loved the place 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
love this phone 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
do not waste your time 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the management is rude 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
great phone 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
dont miss it 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
wont go back 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
very prompt service 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
good product good seller 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
dont waste your money 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
very good quality though 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
fantastic food 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
poor sound quality 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
service stinks here 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the poor actors 0 
buttons are too small 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the acting sucked 0 
waste of money 0 
extremely tasty 1 
works as described 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
item does not match picture 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i am very happy 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
piece of trash 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
you wont regret it 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the acting sucked 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the food amazing 1 
i paid too much 0 
good product incredible value 1 
never got it 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
very easy to use 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
im returning them 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the service was meh 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
worst customer service 0 
it works 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
very disappointing 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
good works fine 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
dont waste your time 0 
they were excellent 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
really ugly 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
works great 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
piece of junk 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i really liked that 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
terrible management 0 
price is good too 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
it worked very well 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
bad reception 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
piece of trash 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
awful 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
gets the job done 1 
there is no real plot 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
very good quality though 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
would not reccommend 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
im returning them 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
worthless product 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
excellent phone 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
excellent performance 1 
dont buy this product 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
painful on the ear 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
works great 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
dont buy it 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
totally believable 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
worth every penny 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
cumbersome design 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
battery life is real good 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
very very fun chef 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
service was fantastic 1 
great price also 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this place lacked style 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
it is an insane game 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
service stinks here 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
good price 1 
the fries were great too 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
doesnt work 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
did not like at all 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the portion was huge 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the acting sucked 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1
