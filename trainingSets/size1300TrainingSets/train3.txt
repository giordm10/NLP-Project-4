definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
im pleased 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
works well 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
better than new 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
worked great 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the film is way too long 0 
would not reccommend 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
worst martini ever 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
does not fit 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
damn good steak 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
poor construction 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
both great 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
does not work 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
this is a great deal 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the portion was huge 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
but its just not funny 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
very happy with this product 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
very poor service 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the cast was great 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
great for ipods too 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
it is shameful 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i never come again 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
its just painful 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
but i dont like it 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
cool phone 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
dont buy this product 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it just blew 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
defective crap 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i love it 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
its just painful 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
check it out 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
very good quality though 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
excellent performance 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
service was fantastic 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
doesnt last long 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
food was delicious 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
it is an insane game 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i love it 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i waited and waited 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
works great 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
dont buy this product 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
disapointing results 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
what a disappointment 0 
portable and it works 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
but i dont like it 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
works great 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i am very happy 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
very happy with this product 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
hated it 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
this is a great little item 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
dont go here 0 
love this product 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
totally believable 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
not enough volume 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
service was fantastic 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the food was terrible 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this is a great deal 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
good price 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the food was terrible 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
dont buy it 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i love this device 1 
worthless product 0 
best headset ever 1 
great product and price 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
very windresistant 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
excellent service 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
very good product well made 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the food is good 1 
great product 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
how awesome is that 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
interesting decor 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
omit watching this 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
very friendly staff 1 
really awful 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
excellent 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
does not fit 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
see both films if you can 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
hated it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the best phone in market 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
too politically correct 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
works good 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
not worth it 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
cool phone 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
its aggravating 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
does not fit 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
why was this film made 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
made very sturdy 1 
good price 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
sweetest phone 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
good quality 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
just what i wanted 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
very disappointed 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
this pda rocks 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
not recommended 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
good case 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
omit watching this 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
mediocre food 0 
well never go again 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
awful 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
not good for the money 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the mic is great 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
very very fun chef 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
service is also cute 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
it is not good 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
very happy with this product 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
im super pissd 0 
the poor actors 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
great earpiece 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
great phone 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i loved it 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
not a good bargain 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
great product 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
what a waste of time 0 
dont waste your money 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
give this one a look 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
buttons are too small 0 
a disappointment 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the best phone in market 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
a standout scene 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
does not fit 0 
very easy to use 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
poor quality 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
not enough volume 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
works great 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
he was terrible 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
im not eating here 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
go watch it 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
give this one a look 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
great bluetooth 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
battery has no life 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
dont buy it 0 
no complaints 1 
go watch it 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
stay away from the q 0 
very disappointed 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
so far so good 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
we wont be going back 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
what a waste 0 
does not fit 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
either way it sucks 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
waitress was good though 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1
