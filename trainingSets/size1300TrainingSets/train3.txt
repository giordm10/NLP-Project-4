not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i was mortified 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
krussel always good 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
great earpiece 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the problem was the script 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i consider this theft 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
why was this film made 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
nice design and quality 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
see both films if you can 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the fries were great too 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
love it great armband 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
it was so cool 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
a great touch 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
great product and price 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i love this device 1 
defective crap 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
very comfortable 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
great case and price 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
again no plot at all 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
doesnt work 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
it was a great phone 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
magical help 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this is infuriating 0 
but its just not funny 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
love it great armband 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
bad purchase 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
not enough volume 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
best headset ever 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
nice sound 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i love it 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
not recommended 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
worst phone ever 0 
either way it sucks 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
id love to go back 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this place has it 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
excellent performance 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
love this product 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
dont waste your time 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
that movie was bad 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the acting was bad 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
great product 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
waste of money 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
not good for the money 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
design flaw 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the service was meh 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
terrible service 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
sooooo good 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
is pretty funny 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
works good 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
im returning them 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
great phone 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
dont waste your time 0 
better than new 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
this place is great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
excellent service 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
would recommend this item 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
better than youd expect 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
not easy to watch 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
very good phone 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
item does not match picture 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great hands free device 1 
is pretty funny 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great movie 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
will be back again 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the acting was bad 0 
piece of junk 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
check it out 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i heart this place 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
wasted two hours 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
check it out 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
not worth it 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
it is not good 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
waste of money 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
really bad 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
better than new 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
do not waste your time 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
doesnt last long 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
dont buy it 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the best phone in market 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
he was terrible 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
con spotty service 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i liked it 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
dont go here 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
very good phone 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
these are fabulous 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
battery has no life 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
owners are really great people 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
better than expected 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
good price 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
go watch it 1 
i am very happy 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
better than expected 1 
you cant beat that 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
warning stay away 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i wont be back 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
total waste of time 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
no complaints 1 
well im satisfied 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
really awful 0 
it worked very well 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
good price 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this is a great little item 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
works fine 1 
i think not again 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
its very slow 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
overall a great experience 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
great earpiece 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
a good time 1 
not impressed 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i love this device 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
con spotty service 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
he was terrible 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the food was very good 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
disappointing 0 
great product and price 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
great food 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i am very happy 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
great phone 1 
it was packed 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
disapointing results 0 
i wont be back 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the food was terrible 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
fantastic food 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
very easy to use 1 
poor reliability 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
very very fun chef 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
its really easy 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
disappointing 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
absolutely great 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
nice leather 1 
worthless product 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
omit watching this 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
we loved the place 1 
not recommended 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
excellent short film 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this is a great deal 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
everything was gross 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
yes its that bad 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
its just painful 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i would recommend it 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
never got it 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the block was amazing 1 
great product for the price 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i love it 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
dont miss it 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
great earpiece 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
not recommended 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
not my thing 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
just what i wanted 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
works great 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
does not fit 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
does not fit 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
would recommend this item 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
very comfortable 1 
mediocre food 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
excellent phone 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
will never ever go back 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
painful on the ear 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i would recommend it 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
worst martini ever 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
gets the job done 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
go watch it 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1
