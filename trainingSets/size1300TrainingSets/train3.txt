an absolute must visit 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
food was really boring 0 
it works 1 
warning do not buy 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
dont go here 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
dont waste your money 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
great case and price 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the management is rude 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i love it 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i really liked that 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i love this place 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
her role was played well 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
great phone 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
its very slow 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
disappointed 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
not what i wanted 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
great phone 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
it is shameful 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i really liked that 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
horrible 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
stay away from the q 0 
dont do it 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
good case 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
there is no real plot 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
youll love it 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
great sound and service 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
great phone 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
very poor service 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
this is a good joint 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
nothing special 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
really good product 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
excellent product 1 
the poor actors 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
good audio quality 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
it is not good 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
piece of trash 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
disappointing experience 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
just does not work 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
works great 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
great food 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the food was very good 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
totally believable 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
service stinks here 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it was so boring 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
that company is a joke 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
battery has no life 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
very disappointing 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
awesome device 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
you wont regret it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this game rocks 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the best phone in market 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
excellent service 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
great choice 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
a good time 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the cast was great 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the acting sucked 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
great price too 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i wont be back 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
everything was gross 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
very disappointing 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
bad reception 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
worthless product 0 
works good 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it was not good 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
good audio quality 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
disappointed 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
no complaints 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
works fine 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it is an insane game 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
crust is not good 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
again lame 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it is not good 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
will not be back 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
worst martini ever 0 
it is shameful 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
bad reception 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
it is not good 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
made very sturdy 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
again lame 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i would recommend this 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i love it 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i consider this theft 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
so just beware 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
great audio 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
horrible phone 0 
very poor service 0 
not worth it 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
great charger 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
dont buy this product 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
this is a great little item 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
will be back again 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
service stinks here 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
very disappointing 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
would not reccommend 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
not recommended 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
how awesome is that 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
bad purchase 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
it was not good 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the food was terrible 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
you wont regret it 1 
really bad 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
made very sturdy 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
crisp and clear 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
go rent it 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
will be back again 1 
excellent product 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
awsome device works great 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i am very happy 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
im not eating here 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it is not good 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
it was horrible 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
easy to use 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
worst thai ever 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
wasted two hours 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
well never go again 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
nice leather 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
gets the job done 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
disappointed 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
what a waste of time 0 
disappointing 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
five star plus plus 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
great product 1 
i waited and waited 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
what a waste of time 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
simply beautiful 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
im super pissd 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
used and dirty 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
over rated 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
1010 1 
easy to use 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
good product incredible value 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
worst ever 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
how awful she is 0 
nice leather 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
item does not match picture 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it is an insane game 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
lousy product 0 
check it out 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
total brunch fail 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
everything stinks 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
battery is terrible 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
these are fabulous 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
great product and price 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
bad choice 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
love this product 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i consider this theft 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
what a disappointment 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
it was awesome 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
fantastic service here 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
what a disappointment 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
magical help 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
great phone 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
highly recommended 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
there is no real plot 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
dont go here 0 
great hands free device 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
not enough volume 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
they are so cool 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
good show samsung 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
better than expected 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
very disappointing 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
damn good steak 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the fries were great too 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it was awesome 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
good prices 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
great movie 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
excellent 1 
this place is great 1 
it was awesome 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i paid too much 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
worst customer service 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
no real improvement 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
good case excellent value 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
works for me 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
defective crap 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
and i really did find them funny 1
