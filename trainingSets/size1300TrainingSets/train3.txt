i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
food was really boring 0 
its really easy 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
not enough volume 0 
i never come again 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
how awful she is 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
good price 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
it worked very well 1 
a pretty good product 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the cast is good 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
made very sturdy 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
poor construction 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
awesome service and food 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
so far so good 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
very disappointed 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
we wont be going back 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
check it out 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
owners are really great people 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
so bad 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
it is a true classic 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
great earpiece 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
omit watching this 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
so they performed 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
worst thai ever 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
highly recommended 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
very very fun chef 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
why was this film made 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this place lacked style 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
very disappointing 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i consider this theft 0 
works great 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
very displeased 0 
piece of junk 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
bad choice 0 
great audio 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
great product and price 1 
wow loved this place 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
just what i wanted 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it was packed 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
nothing special 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
50 down the drain 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
owners are really great people 1 
it was packed 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
worst phone ever 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
dont do it 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i was so insulted 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
really ugly 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
has been working great 1 
i consider this theft 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
good servicecheck 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
terrible management 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
very good phone 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the film is way too long 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
not what i wanted 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
everything was gross 0 
dont buy it 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
very disappointing 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i never come again 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
warning stay away 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
good product good seller 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
service sucks 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
really ugly 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i liked it 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
dont waste your money 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
either way it sucks 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
does not fit 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
give this one a look 1 
and it was boring 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
fantastic food 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
love it great armband 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
great choice 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
poor sound quality 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
excellent phone 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
it worked very well 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i was so insulted 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
left very frustrated 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
so far so good 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
great audio 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
never got it 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
dont buy it 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
was not happy 0 
works fine 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
very good phone 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
its pretty easy 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
very comfortable 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
disappointing experience 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
damn good steak 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
horrible 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
incredible 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
really ugly 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
not easy to watch 0 
worst customer service 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the food amazing 1 
portable and it works 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
very friendly staff 1 
fantastic food 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
great value 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
my order was not correct 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
better than new 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
you cant beat that 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it was equally awful 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
very good though 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i love this place 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
its just lame 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
damn good steak 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
very very sad 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
worst martini ever 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
total waste of time 0 
absolutely great 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
works good 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
food was really boring 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
great hands free device 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
so they performed 1 
will order from them again 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
these are fabulous 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
cool phone 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
was not happy 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
wont go back 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
very disappointing 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
food was really boring 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
everything was gross 0 
it is shameful 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its just painful 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
horrible 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i love this device 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
mediocre food 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
and it was boring 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
not my thing 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i was mortified 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
how awesome is that 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
not recommended 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
its just painful 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the food was very good 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
does not work 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
service was fantastic 1 
wow loved this place 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
disappointing experience 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
very funny 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i never come again 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the problem was the script 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
this is a great little item 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
battery has no life 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0
