i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it was awesome 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
its just painful 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
awful service 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
has been working great 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
warning do not buy 0 
dont waste your money 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
service stinks here 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
very very fun chef 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
love this phone 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
last time buying from you 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
dont waste your money 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this is a great little item 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
design flaw 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
a disappointment 0 
a bit predictable 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
will not be back 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
im returning them 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
works as described 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
worked perfectly 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
great price too 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the acting was bad 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
everything was gross 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
will be back again 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
awesome device 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
great audio 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this game rocks 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i liked it 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
works well 1 
really awful 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
it is shameful 0 
worst customer service 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
great phone 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
this is a great phone 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
horrible phone 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
best headset ever 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i will not return 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
food was average at best 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
really good product 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
portable and it works 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
im pleased 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
good food good service 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
better than youd expect 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
very windresistant 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
this is a great deal 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
would not reccommend 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
youll love it 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
great phone 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
poor product 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this phone works great 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
its a total package 1 
this is a great deal 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
excellent short film 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this phone works great 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
great case and price 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
very easy to use 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
great phone 1 
this place lacked style 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i liked it 1 
made very sturdy 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
better than expected 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
worst customer service 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the service was meh 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
i really liked that 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
wont go back 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
warning stay away 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
works good 1 
dont buy this product 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
used and dirty 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
works great 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
fast service 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i heart this place 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
dont buy it 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
overall a great experience 1 
works well 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
its a great item 1 
warning stay away 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
nice ambiance 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
gets the job done 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
total brunch fail 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
not what i wanted 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
a standout scene 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the cast is good 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
battery has no life 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
id love to go back 1 
horrible phone 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
great phone 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this pda rocks 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
food was average at best 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a good time 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
works good 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
this place is great 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
great phone 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
love it great armband 1 
its just painful 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
disappointed 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
good prices 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
doesnt work 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
great product and price 1 
dont buy it 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
awful service 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
good show samsung 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
great audio 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
this is a great phone 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
awesome service and food 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
it was so boring 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
well never go again 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
crisp and clear 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
warning do not buy 0 
never got it 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
what a waste 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
love it great armband 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it is shameful 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
they are so cool 1 
sending it back 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
both great 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
con spotty service 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
service stinks here 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
and it was boring 0 
nice leather 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
made very sturdy 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
design flaw 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
service is also cute 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
id like to return it 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
very displeased 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
it was a great phone 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
great phone 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i want my money back 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
poor quality and service 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this movie is bad 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
nice design and quality 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
total brunch fail 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
over rated 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
excellent 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
1010 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
1010 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
crust is not good 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
1010 1 
nice design and quality 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
poor quality and service 0 
so they performed 1 
defective crap 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
buttons are too small 0 
very disappointed 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
see both films if you can 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this movie is bad 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the phone loads super 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
very displeased 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
it was so boring 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
great price too 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
excellent service 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
excellent product 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
go watch it 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
not worth it 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this is a great phone 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
will order from them again 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this is a great phone 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
worthwhile 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
not worth it 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
they are so cool 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
good quality 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it was a great phone 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
a good time 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
sending it back 0 
disappointing 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
this is a great deal 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
very bad experience 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
great brunch spot 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
not worth it 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
lousy product 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
not recommended 0 
good case excellent value 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0
