the manager was the worst 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
nothing new there 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
this pda rocks 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
works for me 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the food was very good 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
good case 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
it was equally awful 0 
dont buy it 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
mediocre food 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it was horrible 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this place is amazing 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
im not eating here 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
he was terrible 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
what a waste 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
lousy product 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
this is a good joint 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
again no plot at all 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its very slow 0 
what a waste 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
disappointing 0 
really ugly 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
bad quality 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
absolutely great 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
this movie is bad 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great phone 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
waitress was good though 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
good quality 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
best headset ever 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
we are sending it back 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this is a great little item 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
a standout scene 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
worst thai ever 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
disappointed 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
awesome device 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
its not user friendly 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
it is shameful 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
love this product 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
what a waste 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
hated it 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the block was amazing 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
see it 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
bad purchase 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
well never go again 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i love this thing 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
portable and it works 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
poor product 0 
soggy and not good 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
crust is not good 0 
i liked it 1 
its a total package 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
this is a great phone 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
nice design and quality 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
disapointing results 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
again lame 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
dont do it 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
over rated 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
wasted two hours 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
horrible 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i would recommend this 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i love this thing 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
what a waste of time 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it was horrendous 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
worthwhile 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
disappointed 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
nice design and quality 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
great brunch spot 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
nice leather 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
doesnt last long 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i will not return 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
good show samsung 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
not easy to watch 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
awful 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
will be back again 1 
piece of trash 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
good quality 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
great choice 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
service stinks here 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
id love to go back 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
very happy with this product 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
its just lame 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
its just lame 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
not worth it 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
dont waste your time 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
1010 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
good case excellent value 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it worked very well 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i really liked that 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
not my thing 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
it just blew 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
awful 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
food was average at best 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
great phone 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
great product and price 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
that was funny 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
absolutely great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
service is also cute 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i love this thing 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
go rent it 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
not recommended 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
love it great armband 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it just blew 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
good audio quality 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
good case excellent value 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
im not eating here 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
price is good too 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
terrible management 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
why was this film made 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the best phone in market 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
1010 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
love this headset 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the mic is great 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
omit watching this 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the food amazing 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
does not fit 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
id like to return it 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
a pretty good product 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it looks very nice 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
love this phone 1 
battery life is also great 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
works for me 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
these are fabulous 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
its aggravating 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
im pleased 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
they are so cool 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
fast service 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
would not go back 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
works great 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
was not happy 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
horrible 0 
the food amazing 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
good quality 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
dont buy it 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
very good quality though 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
id like to return it 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
that was nice 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
so far so good 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
highly recommended a 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
overall a great experience 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i wont be back 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
works great 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
dont waste your time 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
so far so good 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
id love to go back 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
excellent phone 1 
love this headset 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
very good product well made 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
sweetest phone 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
worthwhile 1 
wow loved this place 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
crust is not good 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
is pretty funny 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the fries were great too 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
food was really boring 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
this is a great phone 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
portable and it works 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
wasted two hours 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
nice leather 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
great phone 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
worst martini ever 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
magical help 1 
very funny 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
what a disappointment 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
never got it 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
very good phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
works great 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
it was delicious 1
