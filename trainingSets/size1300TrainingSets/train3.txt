each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
poor quality 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
we wont be going back 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
it is shameful 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
works great 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
so bad 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
cumbersome design 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
we wont be going back 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
great service and food 1 
this game rocks 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
over rated 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i wont be back 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it is not good 0 
dont buy it 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
total waste of time 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
works for me 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
go rent it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
that was nice 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
very displeased 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
stay away from the q 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
disapointing results 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
and it was boring 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
good prices 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the acting sucked 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
absolutely great 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
great bluetooth 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
sweetest phone 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not my thing 0 
worst customer service 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
dont buy it 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i waited and waited 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
worst thai ever 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
magical help 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
just does not work 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
good show samsung 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
a great touch 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i wont be back 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
great phone 1 
what a mistake 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
will be back again 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
truly awful 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
im returning them 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
service was very prompt 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
cumbersome design 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it is a true classic 1 
nice design and quality 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
how awful she is 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the best phone in market 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
it was way over fried 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i loved it 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
and it was boring 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it was way over fried 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i was so insulted 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
great choice 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
that was nice 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
will order from them again 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
very good though 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
incredible 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
im super pissd 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
very disappointing 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
does not work 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
excellent phone 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
im super pissd 0 
great product and price 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
very good though 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
it is not good 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
so far so good 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
terrible service 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i wont be back 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
great product and price 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great charger 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
its practically perfect in all of them Â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
they have great dinners 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i am very happy 1 
the film is way too long 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
is pretty funny 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
soggy and not good 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
what a mistake 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
bad purchase 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
wont go back 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
hated it 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
warning do not buy 0 
will never ever go back 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
go watch it 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it works 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
its a great item 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i heart this place 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
great audio 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
worked perfectly 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
highly recommended 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
very very sad 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
warning stay away 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
magical help 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
it works 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
id love to go back 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it was a great phone 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it was so cool 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
piece of trash 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
very good product well made 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
stay away from the q 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
very good quality though 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
would not go back 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
so they performed 1 
the food amazing 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
they were excellent 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
very very fun chef 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
they were excellent 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
im not eating here 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i never come again 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i was mortified 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great audio 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
not a good bargain 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
very disappointing 0 
works well 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
never got it 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i liked it 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
not my thing 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
great charger 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
its not user friendly 0 
so bad 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
great product 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
nice leather 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the acting was bad 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
go watch it 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
doesnt last long 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
excellent phone 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
good transmit audio 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
cool phone 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
really good product 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
great phone 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the problem was the script 0 
doesnt work 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
battery life is real good 1 
it is shameful 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
well never go again 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
too politically correct 0 
poor quality and service 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the cast was great 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
great product and price 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
the portion was huge 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
service was very prompt 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
good value great food great service 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
its a total package 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
very displeased 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
defective crap 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
works for me 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the cast is good 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
not worth it 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
very easy to use 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
amazon sucks 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
its just lame 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it purÃ©ed 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the design is very good4 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1
