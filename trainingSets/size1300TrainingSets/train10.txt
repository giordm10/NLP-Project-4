walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
interesting decor 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
very prompt service 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
mediocre food 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
dont buy this product 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
fantastic service here 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
service stinks here 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
a pretty good product 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
defective crap 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
we loved the place 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
dont waste your money 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
total brunch fail 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
works for me 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
dont waste your money 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
great brunch spot 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
battery is terrible 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
warning do not buy 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
the food amazing 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
it was way over fried 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this is a great phone 1 
truly awful 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
would recommend this item 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this place is great 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i consider this theft 0 
works for me 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
last time buying from you 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the block was amazing 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
service stinks here 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
very very fun chef 1 
very good though 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
disapointing results 0 
will be back again 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
disappointing experience 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
used and dirty 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
very poor service 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
wow loved this place 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
it was packed 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
really good product 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i consider this theft 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the cast is good 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
piece of trash 0 
worth every penny 1 
too politically correct 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
works fine 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
worst ever 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
overall a delight 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
service was fantastic 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
everything is appalling 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
design flaw 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
a standout scene 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
excellent service 1 
the management is rude 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
this is a great deal 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
was not happy 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
disappointing 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
great movie 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
just what i wanted 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
again no plot at all 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
buttons are too small 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
lousy product 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
service is also cute 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
crust is not good 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
great product 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
works fine 1 
sooooo good 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
brilliant 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
great sound and service 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
wow loved this place 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
sooooo good 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
just does not work 0 
waste of money 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
good audio quality 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
disappointing 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
this is a great deal 1 
very good quality though 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
waitress was good though 1 
again no plot at all 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
very poor service 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
will not be back 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
very poor service 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
incredible 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
not enough volume 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
magical help 1 
nice sound 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
excellent service 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
nice design and quality 1 
the food was terrible 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
cumbersome design 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
design flaw 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
incredible 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
disappointing 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
poor product 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
dont waste your money 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i liked it 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
warning stay away 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
not a good bargain 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
im returning them 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i love this thing 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i was mortified 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
great product 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
never got it 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
again no plot at all 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
its very slow 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
great bluetooth 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
would not reccommend 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
so bad 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
never got it 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
it is shameful 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it works 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i was mortified 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the mic is great 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
very good quality though 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
great hands free device 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
this game rocks 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it was packed 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
everything is appalling 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
dont buy it 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i never come again 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
disapointing results 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the management is rude 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
really ugly 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
very good quality though 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
service stinks here 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the cast is good 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
good prices 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
was not happy 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
item does not match picture 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
excellent 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
you wont regret it 1 
delicious 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
terrible management 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
excellent short film 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
horrible 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it was equally awful 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
battery life is real good 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
great product 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
would not reccommend 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
this game rocks 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
dont buy it 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
good servicecheck 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
overall a great experience 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this place is great 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
poor product 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
used and dirty 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
disappointed 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
worked perfectly 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
wow loved this place 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
food was average at best 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
its just lame 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
good servicecheck 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
sooooo good 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
sweetest phone 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
crust is not good 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
works as described 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
its a great item 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this place has it 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
im returning them 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
will order from them again 1 
very disappointing 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the best phone in market 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i wont be back 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i never come again 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
that movie was bad 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
very comfortable 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i really liked that 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
absolutely great 1 
great phone 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
totally believable 1 
not recommended 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
a disappointment 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
total waste of time 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
disappointing 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i paid too much 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
absolutel junk 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
warning stay away 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
very poor service 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0
