a good film by a great director 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
good product good seller 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
awsome device works great 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
wasted two hours 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
great product and price 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
design flaw 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
that company is a joke 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
battery is terrible 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
very disappointed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
go watch it 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
warning stay away 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
does not work 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the food is good 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
will never ever go back 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
last time buying from you 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
works great 1 
krussel always good 1 
a pretty good product 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
awsome device works great 1 
piece of trash 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i waited and waited 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
everything was gross 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
works great 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
dont waste your time 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
this case seems well made 1 
what a mistake 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
very good product well made 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
excellent service 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
portable and it works 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
krussel always good 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
its just lame 0 
very prompt service 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
warning stay away 0 
worthwhile 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
owners are really great people 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the food was terrible 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
he was terrible 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
both great 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
nice ambiance 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
was not happy 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
used and dirty 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
not recommended 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
does not fit 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
kind of flops around 0 
the food was terrible 0 
but its just not funny 0 
five star plus plus 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
sending it back 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
battery life is also great 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
not my thing 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
works great 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
im pleased 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
excellent service 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
what a disappointment 0 
id love to go back 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
better than youd expect 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i consider this theft 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
so far so good 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
you wont regret it 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
works well 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
used and dirty 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
it looks very nice 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i love this device 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
great for ipods too 1 
im not eating here 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i love it 1 
i wont be back 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
dont buy it 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
the acting sucked 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
overall a great experience 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
absolutel junk 0 
great phone 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
used and dirty 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
great phone 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
works as described 1 
well im satisfied 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
good servicecheck 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
not easy to watch 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
piece of trash 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
good case excellent value 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
very friendly staff 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
hated it 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
awesome service and food 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
its a great item 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
im not eating here 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
battery has no life 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
you wont regret it 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the film is way too long 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
piece of trash 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
poor product 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
its just painful 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
worked perfectly 1 
no complaints 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
great earpiece 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
not worth it 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
just does not work 0 
just does not work 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
nice sound 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
brilliant 1 
dont do it 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
great price also 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
food was really boring 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
battery life is also great 1 
they are so cool 1 
they have great dinners 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
magical help 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
there is no real plot 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
doesnt last long 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the battery works great 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
very disappointing 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
kind of flops around 0 
50 down the drain 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
this is a great deal 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i was so insulted 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
good case 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
would not reccommend 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
great phone 1 
its just lame 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
great phone 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i love this place 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
extremely tasty 1 
disappointed 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
easy to use 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
owners are really great people 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
go watch it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
it looks very nice 1 
a pretty good product 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
worthwhile 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
not good for the money 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
great case and price 1 
awsome device works great 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
good case 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
food was really boring 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
well im satisfied 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
overall a great experience 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
this movie is bad 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
dont waste your time 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
this is a great phone 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
dont waste your money 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
im super pissd 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
go and see it 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
really ugly 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this is a great phone 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
it is shameful 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
an hour seriously 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
works well 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it is not good 0 
i loved it 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
was not happy 0 
gets the job done 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
has been working great 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
was not happy 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
terrible service 0 
good case excellent value 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
really ugly 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
sweetest phone 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
very disappointed 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it was so boring 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
we are sending it back 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
we wont be going back 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
great price too 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
what a mistake 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
good prices 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
great product and price 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
incredible 1 
nothing new there 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
very poor service 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
dont buy it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0
