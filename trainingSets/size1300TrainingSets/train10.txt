i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
terrible management 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
great price too 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
nothing new there 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
very good though 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
never going back 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
not recommended 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
very good phone 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
low quality 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
hated it 0 
good prices 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
wont go back 0 
overall a great experience 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
happy so far 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
great phone 1 
five star plus plus 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
very disappointed 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
will never ever go back 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
really ugly 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
battery has no life 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
good prices 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
not my thing 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
very disappointing 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
very disappointed 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
better than new 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
excellent short film 1 
disapointing results 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
dont waste your money 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
portable and it works 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
yes its that bad 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
sweetest phone 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
awful 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
crust is not good 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
dont buy this product 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
damn good steak 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it was a great phone 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
we wont be going back 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
again lame 0 
i love this place 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
i wont be back 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
fast service 1 
this place has it 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
dont buy it 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
awesome device 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
its just painful 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
it was a great phone 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
will not be back 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
great phone 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
do not waste your time 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
damn good steak 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i would recommend it 1 
awesome device 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
fast service 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this movie is bad 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
dont buy it 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
great product for the price 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
just what i wanted 1 
disappointed 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
sweetest phone 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
very displeased 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i would recommend this 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
why was this film made 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
magical help 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i consider this theft 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the food was terrible 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
love this headset 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
this place is amazing 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
nice sound 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
very bad experience 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the acting sucked 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the block was amazing 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
very good though 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the phone loads super 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and it was boring 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
doesnt last long 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
go and see it 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
how awful she is 0 
this is a great deal 1 
item does not match picture 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
youll love it 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the phone loads super 1 
dont waste your money 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
kind of flops around 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
very disappointing 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
really good product 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
overall a delight 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
what a waste 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
how awful she is 0 
it was packed 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the fries were great too 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
dont buy it 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
how awesome is that 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
both great 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
good works fine 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
nice leather 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
go and see it 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i love it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
go and see it 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
a great touch 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
love this phone 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
worthless product 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it was packed 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
how awesome is that 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
would not reccommend 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
very easy to use 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this is infuriating 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the food amazing 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
awsome device works great 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
love this phone 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
im returning them 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
nice sound 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
there is no real plot 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
fast service 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
im pleased 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
they are so cool 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
very displeased 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
great product for the price 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
great phone 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
dont go here 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i would recommend it 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
sooooo good 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
good case 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
it just blew 0 
easy to use 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
works as described 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
1010 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
so just beware 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
very bad experience 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
love this phone 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
that company is a joke 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
so just beware 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
my order was not correct 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
works great 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the food was terrible 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
he was terrible 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
again lame 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
disappointed 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
both great 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
good case 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
doesnt last long 0 
this place is good 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
horrible phone 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
is pretty funny 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
worked perfectly 1 
happy so far 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
how awesome is that 1 
extremely tasty 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
bad choice 0 
its just painful 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
will not be back 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
it was delicious 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
this place lacked style 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
will not be back 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i love this place 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
this place is good 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
was not happy 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the design is very good4 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
good item low price 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
damn good steak 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
dont go here 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
we are sending it back 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the management is rude 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1
