another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
1010 1 
piece of junk 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
bad purchase 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the film is way too long 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
defective crap 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
highly recommended a 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
battery life is real good 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i was mortified 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
not enough volume 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
very happy with this product 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
awesome service and food 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
not worth it 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
it was horrendous 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the fries were great too 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i love this thing 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
works fine 1 
great product 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i am very happy 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
really good product 1 
made very sturdy 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
not worth it 0 
everything was gross 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
great phone 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
it is an insane game 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
great bluetooth 1 
very disappointing 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the food was terrible 0 
its pretty easy 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
fantastic food 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
go rent it 1 
this place is amazing 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
its just lame 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
its a great item 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the acting was bad 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
worthwhile 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
horrible 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
very good phone 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
you wont regret it 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
works fine 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i want my money back 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
very funny 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this place lacked style 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
soggy and not good 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
the food was terrible 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the food was terrible 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
good food good service 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
never got it 0 
cool phone 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
did not like at all 0 
wasted two hours 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
go watch it 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
great product 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
1010 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
over rated 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
just does not work 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
worthless product 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
will definitely be back 1 
last time buying from you 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
better than new 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i love this phone 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
they have great dinners 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
nothing new there 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
kind of flops around 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this movie is bad 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
piece of junk 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
very disappointing 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i consider this theft 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
see it 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i love it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
works great 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
really awful 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
but i dont like it 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
great phone 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
it was a great phone 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
dont waste your money 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i want my money back 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
cumbersome design 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
nothing special 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this place is amazing 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
awesome service and food 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the acting was bad 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
good case excellent value 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
we wont be going back 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
better than expected 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
not enough volume 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
a bit predictable 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
great sound and service 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
will definitely be back 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the mic is great 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
good case excellent value 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i want my money back 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
dont waste your money 0 
i consider this theft 0 
never got it 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
great product and price 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
50 down the drain 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
fast service 1 
better than new 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
nice leather 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
left very frustrated 0 
very disappointing 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
was not happy 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
not easy to watch 0 
cumbersome design 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
excellent performance 1 
this is a great little item 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
really good product 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the acting was bad 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
excellent phone 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i loved it 1 
worst thai ever 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
battery has no life 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
worthwhile 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
worthless product 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
great bluetooth 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
dont waste your money 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
great food 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
not enough volume 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
great price too 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this place is amazing 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
fantastic food 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
dont miss it 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
1010 1 
not enough volume 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
that company is a joke 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
food was delicious 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
it just blew 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i love this place 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
that company is a joke 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
its not user friendly 0 
low quality 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it worked very well 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i waited and waited 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
im super pissd 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
omit watching this 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
dont go here 0 
defective crap 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the fries were great too 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the cast was great 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
left very frustrated 0 
food was really boring 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this is a great deal 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the cast is good 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
im returning them 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
works great 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
the phone loads super 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
magical help 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i love it 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
owners are really great people 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
very displeased 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
overall a delight 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
im not eating here 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
defective crap 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
youll love it 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
how awful she is 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i heart this place 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
easy to use 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
not recommended 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
very easy to use 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
works well 1 
excellent service 1 
worst thai ever 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
but its just not funny 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
very very fun chef 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
did not like at all 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
buttons are too small 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the food was very good 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
this is a great little item 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
just what i wanted 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
it is a true classic 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
a standout scene 1 
i was mortified 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
works great 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i love this thing 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
food was average at best 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
a bit predictable 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
dont buy this product 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1
