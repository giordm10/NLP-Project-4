they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
this place lacked style 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
well im satisfied 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
love this phone 1 
very windresistant 1 
id like to return it 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
lousy product 0 
i love this thing 1 
i will not return 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
very easy to use 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
really awful 0 
not recommended 0 
the management is rude 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
really awful 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
he was terrible 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
its very slow 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
amazon sucks 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
great earpiece 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
battery has no life 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this pda rocks 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
dont waste your money 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
we loved the place 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
sooooo good 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the phone loads super 1 
worthwhile 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
good show samsung 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this is a great deal 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
you wont regret it 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
very displeased 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
both great 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
im pleased 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
piece of trash 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
see it 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the phone loads super 1 
nothing new there 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
worst customer service 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
go and see it 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
i liked it 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
a bit predictable 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
not good for the money 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i love this place 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
will order from them again 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
how awesome is that 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
brilliant 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
good food good service 1 
good servicecheck 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
waste of money 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
1010 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
dont miss it 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the acting sucked 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
totally believable 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
excellent performance 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
service was very prompt 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
so they performed 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it looks very nice 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
go and see it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
excellent phone 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
overall a delight 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
not impressed 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i would recommend this 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
the food was terrible 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
a great touch 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
it worked very well 1 
not enough volume 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i love it 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
will not be back 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
disappointing 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
food was delicious 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
great phone 1 
the problem was the script 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
dont go here 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
disappointing experience 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
poor reliability 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
very good product well made 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
totally believable 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
excellent performance 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
awsome device works great 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
we wont be returning 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
disapointing results 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
good case excellent value 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
works good 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
its just painful 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it looks very nice 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
owners are really great people 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
do not waste your time 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this pda rocks 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
great hands free device 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
does not work 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
good audio quality 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
good price 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
food was average at best 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
nice design and quality 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
will not be back 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
will never ever go back 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i want my money back 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
better than new 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
great phone 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
this place is great 1 
love it great armband 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i love this thing 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
its not user friendly 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i wont be back 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
good value great food great service 1 
too politically correct 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
this pda rocks 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
food was below average 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
great charger 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
buttons are too small 0 
very prompt service 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
that company is a joke 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i was so insulted 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i waited and waited 0 
poor quality and service 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
50 down the drain 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
worked perfectly 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
gets the job done 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
nothing new there 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
cumbersome design 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
very good product well made 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
made very sturdy 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
easy to use 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
worst customer service 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
again no plot at all 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
again lame 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great phone 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
better than new 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
dont do it 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the problem was the script 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
dont waste your money 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
not easy to watch 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
over rated 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
defective crap 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
happy so far 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
total waste of time 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
five star plus plus 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
dont go here 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
overall a delight 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
good case 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
service is also cute 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i want my money back 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
worst ever 0 
this place is good 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i love this place 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
very disappointing 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is a great deal 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
will definitely be back 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
awful 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
used and dirty 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
works good 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
see it 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
very easy to use 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great value 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
total brunch fail 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
it is an insane game 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i will not return 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
very poor service 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
go and see it 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this is a great deal 1 
what a mistake 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
they were excellent 1 
totally believable 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
cumbersome design 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
great phone 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it is shameful 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
not my thing 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
how stupid is that 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
sooooo good 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0
