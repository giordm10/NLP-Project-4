they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
fast service 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
go and see it 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
dont do it 0 
i never come again 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
stay away from the q 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
damn good steak 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
id like to return it 0 
doesnt work 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
im super pissd 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this place is amazing 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
dont go here 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
never got it 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
worked perfectly 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i think not again 0 
why was this film made 0 
its a great item 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it was so boring 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
they were excellent 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
food was delicious 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
we loved the place 1 
overall a great experience 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i love it 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
disappointed 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
fast service 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
im super pissd 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
worked great 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
very displeased 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the cast is good 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
see both films if you can 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
battery has no life 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
bad choice 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
nothing new there 0 
it was a great phone 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
food was average at best 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
good food good service 1 
great value 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the food was terrible 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great phone 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this place lacked style 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this movie is bad 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
very prompt service 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
great service and food 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
its just painful 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
owners are really great people 1 
awful service 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
great choice 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
sooooo good 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
five star plus plus 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
do not waste your time 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
not my thing 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
this game rocks 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
service sucks 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
worst thai ever 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
do not waste your time 0 
stay away from the q 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i was mortified 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
lousy product 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
disappointed 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
so far so good 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
not recommended 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
im super pissd 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
and it was boring 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the acting was bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
disappointing experience 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
good works fine 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
dont waste your time 0 
a good time 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
incredible 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
totally believable 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
con spotty service 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
its pretty easy 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
good price 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i love this place 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it is a true classic 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
great phone 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
very very sad 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
great food 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i love this place 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
used and dirty 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
im not eating here 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
owners are really great people 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
great value 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this place is great 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
these are fabulous 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i really liked that 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
either way it sucks 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
the management is rude 0 
great food 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
painful on the ear 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
but i dont like it 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
lousy product 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
food was delicious 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
go watch it 1 
it was packed 0 
waste of money 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
disappointed 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i heart this place 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
good value great food great service 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
omit watching this 0 
owners are really great people 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the fries were great too 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
disappointing experience 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
fantastic food 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
fast service 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
bad reception 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
brilliant 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
love it great armband 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
this phone works great 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the acting sucked 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
see both films if you can 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
its pretty easy 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
simply beautiful 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
good quality 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
we wont be going back 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it was packed 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
love this product 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
worst martini ever 0 
will order from them again 1 
not impressed 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
works well 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
very funny 1 
dont buy this product 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
worst phone ever 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
its just painful 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
dont waste your time 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
kind of flops around 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very good phone 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
great phone 1 
the poor actors 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
service sucks 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
does not work 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
con spotty service 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
good prices 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
service sucks 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
her role was played well 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
great earpiece 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i love this phone 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
cumbersome design 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
good works fine 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
kind of flops around 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
fantastic food 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
it is an insane game 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the cast is good 1 
good food good service 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it was packed 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
terrible management 0 
great product 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the management is rude 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
service stinks here 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
really awful 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
poor sound quality 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
great food 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
how awful she is 0 
see both films if you can 1 
was not happy 0 
very windresistant 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
would not reccommend 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
really ugly 0 
nice ambiance 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
her role was played well 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0
