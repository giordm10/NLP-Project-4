this is a great phone 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
crust is not good 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
this place is good 1 
her role was played well 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
good item low price 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
so they performed 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
they have great dinners 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
doesnt work 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
very friendly staff 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
great phone 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
the acting was bad 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
battery has no life 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
im returning them 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
worst customer service 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the food was terrible 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
so just beware 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
nothing new there 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
krussel always good 1 
good product incredible value 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
so just beware 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
total brunch fail 0 
i heart this place 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
terrible service 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the food amazing 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
worked great 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
good price 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
great price too 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
this is a great deal 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
not recommended 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very disappointed 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it was horrendous 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
better than youd expect 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
crust is not good 0 
why was this film made 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
magical help 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i heart this place 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
great product and price 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
this pda rocks 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
very windresistant 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
this is a great little item 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the cast was great 1 
really awful 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it was equally awful 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
horrible 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
its really easy 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
it is not good 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
the cast was great 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
poor reliability 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
its just painful 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
again no plot at all 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
battery life is real good 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
very happy with this product 1 
bad choice 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
not easy to watch 0 
did not like at all 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i paid too much 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
1010 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
no complaints 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
its just lame 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
really bad 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
awesome service and food 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
give this one a look 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
do not waste your time 0 
very windresistant 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
what a disappointment 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
im returning them 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
worst martini ever 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
good value great food great service 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
it was so cool 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
worth every penny 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
that was funny 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
a great touch 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
good product good seller 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
great choice 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
battery life is also great 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
highly recommended a 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
excellent performance 1 
warning stay away 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the food was terrible 0 
very windresistant 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
this is infuriating 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i really liked that 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
i consider this theft 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i think not again 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
its just painful 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
not good for the money 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
bad purchase 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
im returning them 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
we are sending it back 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
i liked it 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
nice sound 1 
works for me 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
fantastic food 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
give this one a look 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
great value 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
terrible service 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
im super pissd 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
hated it 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
this place is amazing 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
gets the job done 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
both great 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
waste of money 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
but i dont like it 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
dont buy it 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
give this one a look 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
both great 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the food was terrible 0 
food was delicious 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
just what i wanted 1 
they were excellent 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
great product for the price 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
its just lame 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
worked great 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
price is good too 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
would not reccommend 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
they were excellent 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
buttons are too small 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
dont waste your time 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
that was funny 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
good price 1 
will definitely be back 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
what a mistake 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
it was packed 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
no complaints 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
highly recommended 1 
kind of flops around 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
great product and price 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
fast service 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
mediocre food 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
id like to return it 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
again lame 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
does not work 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
dont waste your time 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
great food 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
not good for the money 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
works good 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
used and dirty 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
over rated 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
check it out 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
the food was terrible 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
stay away from the q 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
never got it 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
good value great food great service 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i heart this place 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the management is rude 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
not recommended 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the cast was great 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
nice sound 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
we loved the place 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
good quality 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
very very fun chef 1 
not what i wanted 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
it was awesome 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
never got it 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
this is a great phone 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
bad quality 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
works as described 1 
very funny 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the food was very good 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
nice leather 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
i really liked that 1 
worked great 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
well im satisfied 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
disappointing experience 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this is a good joint 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
highly recommended a 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
love this phone 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
best headset ever 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
dont go here 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it worked very well 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
poor reliability 0 
terrible management 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
nice sound 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
awful 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
so they performed 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
good price 1 
i cant wait to go back 1
