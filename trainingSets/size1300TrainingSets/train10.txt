i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
but its just not funny 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
price is good too 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
horrible phone 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
dont buy this product 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
good item low price 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
good servicecheck 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
id like to return it 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
crust is not good 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
disappointing experience 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
lousy product 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the fries were great too 1 
very poor service 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
great earpiece 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
very friendly staff 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
great product for the price 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
love this headset 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
they are so cool 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i will not return 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
dont do it 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
warning stay away 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
its pretty easy 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
warning do not buy 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i never come again 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i would recommend it 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
never got it 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
no real improvement 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
very disappointing 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it was delicious 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the cast is good 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
bad quality 0 
totally believable 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this is a great little item 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i love it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
warning do not buy 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
horrible phone 0 
service is also cute 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
worthwhile 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
left very frustrated 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
the food is good 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it was so cool 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
very disappointing 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
will not be back 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
very disappointing 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
awful service 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
not recommended 0 
the poor actors 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
did not like at all 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
is pretty funny 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
works great 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
it is an insane game 1 
this place has it 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the service was meh 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
amazon sucks 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
great choice 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
will order from them again 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
awful 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the fries were great too 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
how awful she is 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the problem was the script 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i paid too much 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
not worth it 0 
overall a delight 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it just blew 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
worst ever 0 
fantastic food 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
im returning them 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
this case seems well made 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
total brunch fail 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
what a disappointment 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
great product for the price 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
worthless product 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
works great 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
love this headset 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
great product for the price 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
nice design and quality 1 
this is a great little item 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
absolutely great 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
not my thing 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
does not fit 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
very easy to use 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
is pretty funny 1 
will not be back 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
does not fit 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
nothing special 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i love this device 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this case seems well made 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
that company is a joke 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
not recommended 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
do not waste your time 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
never going back 0 
you wont regret it 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
it was awesome 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
i never come again 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
service sucks 0 
great audio 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
so they performed 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
eclectic selection 1 
did not like at all 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
it was a great phone 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
really good product 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
mediocre food 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
excellent product 1 
check it out 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
dont go here 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
fantastic food 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
i wont be back 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
this place lacked style 0 
low quality 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
great food 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
why was this film made 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
everything was gross 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
this place is good 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
we wont be going back 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
brilliant 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this place has it 1 
im pleased 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
dont go here 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
they have great dinners 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
very very fun chef 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i am very happy 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
would not go back 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i really liked that 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
battery life is real good 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
very friendly staff 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
1010 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
worst martini ever 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
again no plot at all 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i waited and waited 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
service sucks 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
food was really boring 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
well im satisfied 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
awful service 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
was not happy 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the fries were great too 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
lousy product 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
food was really boring 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
will order from them again 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
youll love it 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
not good for the money 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
go rent it 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
mediocre food 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
what a waste of time 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
lousy product 0 
everything was gross 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i think not again 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its pretty easy 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
this is a great deal 1 
battery is terrible 0 
well im satisfied 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
im returning them 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
very bad experience 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
awesome device 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
hated it 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
im not eating here 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
damn good steak 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
horrible 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
this is a great phone 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
i love it 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
not recommended 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
it was horrible 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
1010 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
so they performed 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
excellent performance 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
battery is terrible 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i really liked that 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
sooooo good 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
dont buy it 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
bad purchase 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
yes its that bad 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
love this product 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
go watch it 1 
great phone 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
terrible management 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it worked very well 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0
