i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
stay away from the q 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
not enough volume 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i heart this place 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i wont be back 0 
nice design and quality 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
awful service 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
just does not work 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
battery life is real good 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
magical help 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
wont go back 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
it was not good 0 
great value 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
good show samsung 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
works good 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the service was meh 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
love this product 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
im pleased 1 
works great 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
not worth it 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
great product for the price 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
good price 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
wont go back 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
the food is good 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
it was awesome 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
great audio 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
that was funny 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
we loved the place 1 
it was not good 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
wasted two hours 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
dont go here 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
again no plot at all 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
good price 1 
worst ever 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
disappointed 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
this is infuriating 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
totally believable 1 
great product 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i paid too much 0 
its a total package 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the food was very good 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
we wont be returning 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
its aggravating 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
see both films if you can 1 
amazon sucks 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
it is shameful 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
sending it back 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
not my thing 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
go watch it 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
it was equally awful 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
a disappointment 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the cast was great 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
terrible management 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
great audio 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
better than new 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
this is infuriating 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
very disappointing 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
buttons are too small 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it is an insane game 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the battery works great 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
how awful she is 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the food amazing 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
disappointed 0 
dont do it 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
nothing new there 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
this phone works great 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
interesting decor 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
not recommended 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
does not fit 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
better than expected 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
price is good too 1 
how stupid is that 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
it was way over fried 0 
very happy with this product 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
very happy with this product 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
dont waste your time 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
very good phone 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
worked great 1 
an hour seriously 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
excellent performance 1 
amazon sucks 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very displeased 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
this pda rocks 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
it is an insane game 1 
it was way over fried 0 
we wont be returning 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
last time buying from you 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
poor product 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
works great 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
excellent 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
dont buy this product 0 
better than new 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
we wont be returning 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
not recommended 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
excellent short film 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
very bad experience 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
dont miss it 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
disappointed 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
really awful 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
it is an insane game 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
dont waste your time 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
easy to use 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
will not be back 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
it was so boring 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
this is a great little item 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
service was fantastic 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
great food 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
very disappointing 0 
very disappointed 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
will never ever go back 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i want my money back 0 
im not eating here 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the management is rude 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
service stinks here 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
works great 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
never got it 0 
worst thai ever 0 
really ugly 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
this phone works great 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i was mortified 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
service was very prompt 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
does not work 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
its just lame 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
sooooo good 1 
i wont be back 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
better than expected 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
used and dirty 0 
excellent 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
good works fine 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
works for me 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i would recommend it 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this game rocks 1 
highly recommended a 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
great food 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
it is shameful 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
will not be back 0 
worst ever 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the poor actors 0 
worked great 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
will be back again 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
very easy to use 1 
great brunch spot 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
five star plus plus 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
id like to return it 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
dont buy it 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
has been working great 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i consider this theft 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
well im satisfied 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
just what i wanted 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
very bad experience 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
very disappointed 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i heart this place 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it was so cool 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i paid too much 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
would not go back 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
a disappointment 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
bad reception 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
warning stay away 0 
good audio quality 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
dont waste your time 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
very windresistant 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
that was nice 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the management is rude 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
good works fine 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it was equally awful 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
good quality 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
soggy and not good 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the mic is great 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i liked it 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
i love this device 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
see it 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
great service and food 1 
it is an insane game 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
not my thing 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
the food amazing 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
so bad 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the fries were great too 1 
sweetest phone 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i will not return 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
brilliant 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
was not happy 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
this is a great deal 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
battery life is also great 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
will order from them again 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
crust is not good 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i really liked that 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0
