everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
fantastic service here 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the cast is good 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
it was so boring 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
why was this film made 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
battery has no life 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
very funny 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i wont be back 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
ill even say it again Â– this is torture 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
very very fun chef 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
disappointed 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
poor quality 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
battery is terrible 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
well im satisfied 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
50 down the drain 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
good food good service 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
love this phone 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
fast service 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the best phone in market 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
very bad experience 0 
very happy with this product 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
you wont regret it 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
again lame 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
this is a good joint 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i waited and waited 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
it works 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the fries were great too 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it was horrible 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
brilliant 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
its not user friendly 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it was horrendous 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
great choice 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
it just blew 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
battery life is also great 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it was equally awful 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
did not like at all 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
worked perfectly 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
that was nice 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the mic is great 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this place is amazing 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
nice sound 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
totally believable 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
we are sending it back 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
an hour seriously 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
disappointing experience 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great choice 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
did not like at all 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
wont go back 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
love this headset 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
you cant beat that 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
better than expected 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
well im satisfied 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
terrible service 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
great audio 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
painful on the ear 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
not enough volume 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the acting was bad 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
good price 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
a disappointment 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
interesting decor 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
no complaints 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
love this product 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
it was equally awful 0 
bad purchase 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
bad reception 0 
service is also cute 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
very friendly staff 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
price is good too 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
nice sound 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this is a great little item 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the film is way too long 0 
works for me 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
so far so good 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
never got it 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
portable and it works 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the design is very good4 1 
great phone 1 
everything was gross 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the management is rude 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
fast service 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
excellent performance 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the battery works great 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
waste your money on this game 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
was not happy 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the block was amazing 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
great product and price 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
eclectic selection 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
dont buy this product 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
very windresistant 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
stay away from the q 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
cumbersome design 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
great product for the price 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
price is good too 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
con spotty service 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
defective crap 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
and it was boring 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
terrible service 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
love this product 1 
gets the job done 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
very very sad 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
her role was played well 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
this place is great 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the service was meh 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
disappointed 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
works good 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
cool phone 1 
dont buy it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
buttons are too small 0 
crust is not good 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
awesome device 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
its a total package 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
its just lame 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
left very frustrated 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
has been working great 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the service was meh 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
they were excellent 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
do not waste your time 0 
everything stinks 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
works fine 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it was packed 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
great product 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the battery works great 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
not recommended 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
excellent phone 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
very disappointing 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
so just beware 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
so they performed 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great phone 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
good prices 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
but i dont like it 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
good servicecheck 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
bad quality 0 
again no plot at all 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
works fine 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
very good product well made 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
so just beware 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
not good for the money 0 
great brunch spot 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
not my thing 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
it was delicious 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
do not waste your time 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
excellent product 1 
great service and food 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
poor reliability 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
it looks very nice 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
was not happy 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
works great 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is a great little item 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
its just painful 0 
why was this film made 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
food was delicious 1 
not my thing 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
but its just not funny 0 
never got it 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
my fiancÃ© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the food was terrible 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
very disappointed 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
i love this device 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
excellent product for the price 1
