i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
food was average at best 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
good prices 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
love it great armband 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
defective crap 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
wont go back 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
i love this phone 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
terrible service 0 
great sound and service 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
worthwhile 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
not my thing 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
buttons are too small 0 
its a great item 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i heart this place 1 
easy to use 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
but its just not funny 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
defective crap 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
price is good too 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
good case 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
awesome device 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
its a total package 1 
disappointed 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
we wont be going back 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
this place is great 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
sweetest phone 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
they were excellent 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this is a great phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
worthwhile 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
this is a great phone 1 
check it out 1 
delicious 1 
a standout scene 1 
service sucks 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i paid too much 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
good prices 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
bad choice 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
never going back 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
id like to return it 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
i heart this place 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
price is good too 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
great earpiece 1 
very disappointed 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
too politically correct 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
awful service 0 
it was so cool 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
never going back 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i love this phone 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
not recommended 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
awful 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
would recommend this item 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the cast is good 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
excellent phone 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
check it out 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the mic is great 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
it is an insane game 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
works well 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
great product and price 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
good works fine 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
disappointed 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the service was meh 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i will not return 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
he was terrible 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it was so cool 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
very funny 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
very prompt service 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
very funny 1 
was not happy 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
great value 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
dont go here 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
you cant beat that 1 
go and see it 1 
good product incredible value 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i paid too much 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
bad reception 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i will not return 0 
love this product 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
worst ever 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i waited and waited 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the mic is great 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
dont waste your time 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
service was fantastic 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
kind of flops around 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the poor actors 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
does not work 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
see both films if you can 1 
gets the job done 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
awesome service and food 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
i heart this place 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i love this thing 1 
excellent service 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
my order was not correct 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
good works fine 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
wont go back 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
and it was boring 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
works as described 1 
item does not match picture 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
great phone 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
not good for the money 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
so bad 0 
this case seems well made 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
worst thai ever 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the acting was bad 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
but its just not funny 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
absolutel junk 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
so far so good 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
50 down the drain 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
its pretty easy 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it was way over fried 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the food amazing 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
total waste of time 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
food was really boring 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
item does not match picture 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i liked it 1 
both great 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
dont miss it 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
used and dirty 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they were excellent 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the cast is good 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
gets the job done 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
a disappointment 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
great phone 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great phone 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
lousy product 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
is pretty funny 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
never going back 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
my order was not correct 0 
not impressed 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
an hour seriously 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
excellent service 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
sending it back 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
excellent phone 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
gets the job done 1 
a disappointment 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
disapointing results 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
amazon sucks 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
will never ever go back 0 
great phone 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
worthless product 0 
dont waste your money 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
it was so cool 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
doesnt last long 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
great for ipods too 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the food was terrible 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
doesnt last long 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
warning stay away 0 
great product for the price 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
warning stay away 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
damn good steak 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
this is a great little item 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
great case and price 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
very funny 1 
great value 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
worst ever 0 
disapointing results 0 
did not like at all 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
easy to use 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
well never go again 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
disappointed 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
not impressed 0 
worthless product 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
im not eating here 0 
worthless product 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
will not be back 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
defective crap 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
very disappointing 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
really awful 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
why was this film made 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
overall a delight 1 
nice ambiance 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0
