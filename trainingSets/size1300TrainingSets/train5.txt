the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
love this phone 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
battery has no life 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
nice design and quality 1 
doesnt work 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
not recommended 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
would not go back 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
so they performed 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
terrible service 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
i love it 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
left very frustrated 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
the design is very good4 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i paid too much 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
absolutely great 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
good price 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
great phone 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
just does not work 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
wasted two hours 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great phone 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
never got it 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
dont do it 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
absolutely great 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
great product 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
it was delicious 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
poor product 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
great phone 1 
again no plot at all 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
wow loved this place 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
horrible phone 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
it was not good 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
battery has no life 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
but its just not funny 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
price is good too 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
what a waste 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
but i dont like it 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
very funny 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
i want my money back 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
what a waste 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i heart this place 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
it was way over fried 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
very easy to use 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
it was horrible 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
excellent 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
great case and price 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
i love it 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
never going back 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
dont do it 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the design is very good4 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
a disappointment 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
we wont be returning 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
great phone 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
bad choice 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
battery life is also great 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
we are sending it back 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
great audio 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
service was fantastic 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
id love to go back 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
id love to go back 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
brilliant 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
doesnt work 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
great sound and service 1 
great charger 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
again no plot at all 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
the design is very good4 1 
love this product 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it was equally awful 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
terrible management 0 
love this phone 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
good prices 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
works great 1 
everything was gross 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
great charger 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
great phone 1 
dont go here 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
works good 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
they have great dinners 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
no complaints 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
bad quality 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
absolutely great 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
this place has it 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
worthwhile 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
wont go back 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
love this product 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
i liked it 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
food was below average 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
love this product 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
but its just not funny 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
good transmit audio 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
doesnt work 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
bad purchase 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
poor quality and service 0 
battery life is also great 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
worked great 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
wow loved this place 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
good prices 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
how awesome is that 1 
it was horrible 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great phone 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it looks very nice 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
good item low price 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
doesnt work 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
used and dirty 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i never come again 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
never going back 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
im super pissd 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they have great dinners 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
just what i wanted 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
great product 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
i love this thing 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
great case and price 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i wont be back 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
nice design and quality 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the management is rude 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
food was really boring 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
nothing new there 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
con spotty service 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
really awful 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
simply beautiful 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
disapointing results 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
owners are really great people 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
awesome device 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
used and dirty 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
excellent service 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1

my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
we loved the place 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
krussel always good 1

painful on the ear 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
what a mistake 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
disapointing results 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
and it was boring 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
eclectic selection 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the service was meh 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
interesting decor 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
very disappointed 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
not what i wanted 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
see it 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
very disappointed 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
you wont regret it 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
has been working great 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
love this headset 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
very easy to use 1 
piece of trash 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
the food is good 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
it was awesome 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
a standout scene 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i was mortified 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
nothing new there 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
check it out 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
how stupid is that 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
magical help 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i was mortified 0 
excellent performance 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
too politically correct 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
doesnt work 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
its really easy 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i love it 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
see it 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
its a total package 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
worked great 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
stay away from the q 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
very friendly staff 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
that was funny 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
go watch it 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
how awful she is 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0
