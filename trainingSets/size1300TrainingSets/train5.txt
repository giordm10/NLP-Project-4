it also had a new problem 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
im pleased 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
this phone works great 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
i heart this place 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
it worked very well 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
portable and it works 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
very good though 1 
the problem was the script 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
so far so good 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this place is good 1 
that company is a joke 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it was way over fried 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
not enough volume 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the battery works great 1 
love this product 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
highly recommended 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
again lame 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i love this phone 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
this is a great deal 1 
low quality 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i wont be back 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
absolutel junk 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the fries were great too 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
its very slow 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
very disappointing 0 
see both films if you can 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i was so insulted 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
very funny 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
very good phone 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
will not be back 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
very good though 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
nice ambiance 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
great sound and service 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
very good though 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
this is a good joint 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
very good product well made 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
they have great dinners 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
service was fantastic 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
dont go here 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
not my thing 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
doesnt work 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this phone works great 1 
does not fit 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
very happy with this product 1 
good case excellent value 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great phone 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the fries were great too 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
five star plus plus 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
portable and it works 1 
i wont be back 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
made very sturdy 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
omit watching this 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
very easy to use 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
very displeased 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
well never go again 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the food was very good 1 
better than expected 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
poor product 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
good audio quality 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
not recommended 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
it was a great phone 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
worst thai ever 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
how awful she is 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it was not good 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
very bad experience 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
but i dont like it 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
excellent 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
love it great armband 1 
too politically correct 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
just does not work 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
not impressed 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
dont buy this product 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
this place is great 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it was delicious 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
works as described 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
not a good bargain 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
love this product 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
a standout scene 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
worst martini ever 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
poor quality 0 
it was horrendous 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this movie is bad 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
both great 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
works great 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
omit watching this 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
bad choice 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
great earpiece 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
does not work 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
nothing new there 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
price is good too 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
its a great item 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
terrible service 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i love it 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
im returning them 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
a pretty good product 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
this is a great little item 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i think not again 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
very disappointed 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
does not work 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
food was really boring 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
very disappointed 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
either way it sucks 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
awful 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
love this product 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
easy to use 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
not a good bargain 0 
good prices 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
portable and it works 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
it was so boring 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
does not fit 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
this place is great 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
awful service 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
damn good steak 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the food was terrible 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
highly recommended 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
very disappointing 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
works great 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
not a good bargain 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
well im satisfied 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
we wont be going back 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
works great 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
poor quality 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
very bad experience 0 
how awful she is 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
its just painful 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great product 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the portion was huge 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
magical help 1 
highly recommended a 1 
nice design and quality 1 
not my thing 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
what a waste of time 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
how stupid is that 0 
food was delicious 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
total brunch fail 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
it was awesome 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
not a good bargain 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
excellent service 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
better than expected 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
better than new 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the food is good 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
disappointing 0 
worst martini ever 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
battery life is also great 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
left very frustrated 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the transfers are very good 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
go and see it 1 
its not user friendly 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
well im satisfied 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
this place has it 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
great case and price 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this place has it 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the design is very good4 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
great case and price 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
last time buying from you 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
simply beautiful 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
what a disappointment 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
it was so cool 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
awsome device works great 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
works well 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
would not reccommend 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it is not good 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
best headset ever 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
interesting decor 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
good case excellent value 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this is a great deal 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
good case 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
great product 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
great price also 1 
food was delicious 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
will order from them again 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the portion was huge 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
a bit predictable 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
sweetest phone 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
im pleased 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0
