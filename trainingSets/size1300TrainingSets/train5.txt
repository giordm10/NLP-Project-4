sauce was tasteless 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i love this device 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
good product incredible value 1 
incredible 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
do not waste your time 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
we are sending it back 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
dont buy it 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
piece of junk 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
it was so boring 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
this is a great deal 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
i will not return 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
piece of trash 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
the poor actors 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
very bad experience 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
con spotty service 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
extremely tasty 1 
very easy to use 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
doesnt last long 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
great choice 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
disappointing experience 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
disappointed 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the problem was the script 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very comfortable 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
its just lame 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i wont be back 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
total waste of time 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i really liked that 1 
i am very happy 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
great sound and service 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
great hands free device 1 
sooooo good 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
they have great dinners 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i am very happy 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
very friendly staff 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
fantastic service here 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
good servicecheck 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
disappointing experience 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
total brunch fail 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
great brunch spot 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
food was below average 0 
horrible phone 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
battery is terrible 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
great product and price 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
very very sad 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
sweetest phone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
highly recommended a 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
but its just not funny 0 
does not fit 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
again lame 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it was horrible 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
not what i wanted 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
total waste of time 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very good quality though 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
dont waste your money 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i paid too much 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
will be back again 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
gets the job done 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
really ugly 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
great brunch spot 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
omit watching this 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
great phone 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
just what i wanted 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
dont do it 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
again no plot at all 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
id love to go back 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
has been working great 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
50 down the drain 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
go watch it 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
good product good seller 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
worst thai ever 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
not my thing 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
will never ever go back 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
damn good steak 1 
used and dirty 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
stay away from the q 0 
does not work 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
great service and food 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
waitress was good though 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the poor actors 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
dont buy it 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
very easy to use 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
yes its that bad 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
great product and price 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it works 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
this is a good joint 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
dont buy it 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
dont waste your money 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
does not fit 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
bad choice 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
truly awful 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
no complaints 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
how stupid is that 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
over rated 0 
love it great armband 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
great software for motorolas 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this place lacked style 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
not worth it 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
magical help 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
absolutel junk 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
bad quality 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
great hands free device 1 
terrible management 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
what a waste 0 
warning do not buy 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
service stinks here 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
worst phone ever 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
i liked it 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i paid too much 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
great phone 1 
the management is rude 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
great product and price 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
horrible 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
this case seems well made 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
it is an insane game 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
very good though 1 
the battery works great 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
this phone works great 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
hated it 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
good case 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
excellent 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
battery has no life 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
you cant beat that 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
was not happy 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
so they performed 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
dont go here 0 
it just blew 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
was not happy 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
total brunch fail 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
this place is great 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i paid too much 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
disappointing experience 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
excellent 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the portion was huge 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it was awesome 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
great product 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
awsome device works great 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
terrible management 0 
worth every penny 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
last time buying from you 0 
great phone 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
total waste of time 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
wont go back 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
but its just not funny 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
very bad experience 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
does not fit 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
id like to return it 0 
owners are really great people 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
just what i wanted 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
dont waste your time 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
has been working great 1 
disapointing results 0 
works as described 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
there is no real plot 0 
would recommend this item 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
really bad 0 
it just blew 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
great sound and service 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
what a waste of time 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
excellent short film 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
bad choice 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
great audio 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
simply beautiful 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the phone loads super 1 
piece of trash 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
excellent product 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
very prompt service 1 
really bad 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i liked it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
hated it 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
very friendly staff 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
total waste of time 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the portion was huge 1 
warning stay away 0 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
both great 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
very good quality though 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
this is a great deal 1 
it was packed 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
very good quality though 1 
good food good service 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
love it great armband 1 
works as described 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
food was average at best 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1
