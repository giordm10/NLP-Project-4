and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
worst thai ever 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
you wont regret it 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
service was fantastic 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
love this headset 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
warning do not buy 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
nice ambiance 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
dont waste your time 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
it was so boring 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
very easy to use 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this phone works great 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
the block was amazing 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
battery has no life 0 
absolutel junk 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
go rent it 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
bad purchase 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
a great touch 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
works well 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
dont go here 0 
works great 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the service was meh 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
nice sound 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i love it 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the cast was great 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i paid too much 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
love this headset 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
ill even say it again ¬ñ this is torture 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
mediocre food 0 
just what i wanted 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
cool phone 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
the food was terrible 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
disappointed 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
this game rocks 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
that was nice 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
give this one a look 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
battery has no life 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
waste of money 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
very good quality though 1 
the block was amazing 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
buttons are too small 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
what a waste 0 
1010 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
worst ever 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
how stupid is that 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
great case and price 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
a standout scene 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
worst ever 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
really good product 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
very good quality though 1 
you wont regret it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
good prices 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
50 down the drain 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
horrible phone 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
they are so cool 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
worst thai ever 0 
defective crap 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
good product incredible value 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
service stinks here 0 
awsome device works great 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
sending it back 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
great food 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
very happy with this product 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1

my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
awful service 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
disappointing experience 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
do not waste your time 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
great sound and service 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
worst customer service 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
bad choice 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
it was packed 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the poor actors 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
nothing special 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
item does not match picture 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
a good time 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the management is rude 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i would recommend this 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
worst ever 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
food was delicious 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
this is a great little item 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
this is a great little item 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
food was average at best 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i love this place 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this place is great 1 
these are fabulous 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
disapointing results 0 
poor construction 0 
gets the job done 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
great food 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
used and dirty 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
again lame 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
does not work 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
there is no real plot 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
con spotty service 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
crust is not good 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
better than expected 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
doesnt last long 0 
i am very happy 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
that company is a joke 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
owners are really great people 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
terrible service 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
im returning them 0 
bad quality 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
very disappointed 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
will definitely be back 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
works fine 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
not my thing 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
absolutel junk 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
great phone 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
disapointing results 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
bad quality 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the mic is great 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
painful on the ear 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
incredible 1 
it was packed 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
battery has no life 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
poor sound quality 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
yes its that bad 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
do not waste your time 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
sooooo good 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
works for me 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i consider this theft 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
not worth it 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
will not be back 0 
this is a great deal 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i want my money back 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
works good 1 
dont waste your time 0 
battery life is also great 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
will be back again 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
excellent service 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
very displeased 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
no real improvement 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
it was so funny 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the service was meh 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
worked great 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
would recommend this item 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
excellent performance 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
do not waste your time 0 
mediocre food 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
dont waste your money 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
not impressed 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
it was way over fried 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
damn good steak 1 
dont buy this product 0 
check it out 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
too politically correct 0 
works for me 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the acting was bad 0 
waste of money 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the design is very good4 1 
50 down the drain 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
see both films if you can 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i want my money back 0 
not recommended 0 
overall a delight 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
this is infuriating 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
great sound and service 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
battery has no life 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
great audio 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
low quality 0 
service was very prompt 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
service stinks here 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
nice ambiance 1 
not what i wanted 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
go rent it 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
1010 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
not good for the money 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
works great 1 
this is a good joint 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
it was horrendous 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i would recommend it 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
the problem was the script 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the service was meh 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
used and dirty 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
totally believable 1 
im not eating here 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0
