what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
worst martini ever 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
price is good too 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it was not good 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
very poor service 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the mic is great 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
worked great 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
disappointed 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
its pretty easy 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
great price too 1 
overall a great experience 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
terrible management 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
well im satisfied 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
disappointed 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
well im satisfied 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
nothing new there 0 
im not eating here 0 
great price also 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
you wont regret it 1 
great sound and service 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
the phone loads super 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
it is a true classic 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
very windresistant 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
my order was not correct 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
great phone 1 
it was way over fried 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
kind of flops around 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
will order from them again 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i would recommend this 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
awesome device 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
food was delicious 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the food was terrible 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
fantastic service here 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
sooooo good 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
love this product 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
its very slow 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
nothing special 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this place is good 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
item does not match picture 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
good servicecheck 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
very displeased 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
hated it 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
would not reccommend 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
i was so insulted 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
battery life is real good 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
it was so boring 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
how awful she is 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
warning stay away 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
service is also cute 1 
i paid too much 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
service is also cute 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
not what i wanted 0 
very disappointed 0 
i will not return 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
worst ever 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
its really easy 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
what a disappointment 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
krussel always good 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
does not work 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
a standout scene 1 
they have great dinners 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
great food 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
great price too 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the cast is good 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the block was amazing 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it worked very well 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
works well 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
worst customer service 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
good works fine 1 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
easy to use 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
just does not work 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is a great little item 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
would recommend this item 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
its pretty easy 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
the poor actors 0 
very bad experience 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
so they performed 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
overall a great experience 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
an hour seriously 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i wont be back 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
made very sturdy 1 
battery is terrible 0 
we wont be going back 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
magical help 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
very funny 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
we wont be returning 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
terrible management 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
omit watching this 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
did not like at all 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
this game rocks 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
will definitely be back 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
it worked very well 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
dont waste your time 0 
very very sad 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
worthless product 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
my order was not correct 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
good case excellent value 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
works great 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
bad purchase 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
no complaints 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
food was delicious 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
nice leather 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
its just lame 0 
it is a true classic 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
very disappointed 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
left very frustrated 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
service stinks here 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i love it 1 
you cant beat that 1 
it was so funny 1 
disappointed 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
so bad 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
dont miss it 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
will not be back 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
battery life is also great 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
very good phone 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
not recommended 0 
not recommended 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
it looks very nice 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
wow loved this place 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this is a great deal 1 
hated it 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
portable and it works 1 
used and dirty 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
worst thai ever 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
the best phone in market 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
piece of trash 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
this movie is bad 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the design is very good4 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
sooooo good 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
very good quality though 1 
low quality 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
its really easy 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
there is no real plot 0 
the food was very good 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
he was terrible 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
terrible service 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
how awful she is 0 
good audio quality 1 
the cast was great 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i wont be back 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
hated it 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
works great 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
you wont regret it 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
magical help 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
food was really boring 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
does not work 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
we wont be going back 0 
never going back 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
so just beware 0 
it was so funny 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
very funny 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this place is great 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
great sound and service 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the food is good 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
over rated 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
dont buy it 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
waste of money 0 
dont waste your money 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the mic is great 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
bad reception 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
waste of money 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
youll love it 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the food amazing 1 
very good phone 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
it is an insane game 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
worst customer service 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i consider this theft 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
dont go here 0 
i love it 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it looks very nice 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
warning do not buy 0 
doesnt last long 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
very disappointing 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
very disappointing 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
very good though 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
food was average at best 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this is a great deal 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i am very happy 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the acting was bad 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
awsome device works great 1 
bad purchase 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
doesnt work 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
poor product 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the fries were great too 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
soggy and not good 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
really ugly 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
absolutely great 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
poor quality and service 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it is a true classic 1 
id like to return it 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i was mortified 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
warning do not buy 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
well never go again 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
works well 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
incredible 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
how stupid is that 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1
