you wont regret it 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
i liked it 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
not impressed 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the food amazing 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
go watch it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
fantastic service here 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
why was this film made 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
did not like at all 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
good transmit audio 1 
so bad 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
would not reccommend 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great phone 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
dont waste your money 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
price is good too 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
cumbersome design 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
this phone works great 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
battery is terrible 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
totally believable 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
very poor service 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
omit watching this 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
bad reception 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i will not return 0 
he was terrible 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
very bad experience 0 
they have great dinners 1 
good product incredible value 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
over rated 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
very comfortable 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
piece of trash 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this case seems well made 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great phone 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
battery is terrible 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
worst customer service 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
disappointing experience 0 
worst martini ever 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
my order was not correct 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
these are fabulous 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
very bad experience 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
they have great dinners 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i love this place 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
great brunch spot 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
food was delicious 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
crisp and clear 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
no real improvement 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
very displeased 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
defective crap 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the food was very good 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i heart this place 1 
its just lame 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
well never go again 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this place is good 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
do not waste your time 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
will be back again 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
how awful she is 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
eclectic selection 1 
i love this place 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
good food good service 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pur√©ed 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
its pretty easy 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
extremely tasty 1 
incredible 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
great price also 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
what a mistake 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
owners are really great people 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
good case 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
great phone 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the service was meh 0 
the block was amazing 1 
nothing new there 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
i would recommend it 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
worked great 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
not worth it 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
a bit predictable 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
magical help 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
go watch it 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
good audio quality 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
piece of junk 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
good transmit audio 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
i would recommend this 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
would not reccommend 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
everything was gross 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
im returning them 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is a great little item 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
go and see it 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
great food 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
50 down the drain 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
it was so funny 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
love this phone 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i wont be back 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
disappointing experience 0 
not worth it 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
bad quality 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
was not happy 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
its a total package 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
terrible management 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
love it great armband 1 
i love this thing 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
sooooo good 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
its very slow 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great phone 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
poor product 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
we wont be returning 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
great audio 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
works great 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
works fine 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
horrible 0 
love this headset 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
i wont be back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
low quality 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
this is a great deal 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
id love to go back 1 
battery is terrible 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
was not happy 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
awesome device 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the food was very good 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
incredible 1 
very displeased 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
service sucks 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
excellent performance 1 
this game rocks 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
great phone 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
overall a great experience 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
great charger 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
he was terrible 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
love this product 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
hated it 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
but its just not funny 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
battery life is real good 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
nice leather 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
give this one a look 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
bad quality 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
very friendly staff 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
bad purchase 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this is a great deal 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
con spotty service 0 
awful service 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
this is infuriating 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
not my thing 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the food amazing 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
extremely tasty 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
did not like at all 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
waste of money 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
why was this film made 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
bad reception 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this place lacked style 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
awful service 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
mediocre food 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
poor quality 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
check it out 1 
great audio 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
fast service 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
great charger 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i liked it 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
lets start with all the problems¬óthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
the cast is good 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
good works fine 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i love this place 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
very displeased 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
warning stay away 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
it was horrible 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the food is good 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
great phone 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
nice leather 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
it was so boring 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
krussel always good 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
good item low price 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
these are fabulous 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i wont be back 0 
its really easy 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
check it out 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
so bad 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i wont be back 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the script is bad very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
very disappointing 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
incredible 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
horrible phone 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
awful service 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the problem was the script 0
