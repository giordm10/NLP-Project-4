the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
love this headset 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
very funny 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the design is very good4 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
service sucks 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
it was delicious 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
really awful 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
does not fit 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
design flaw 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
overall a delight 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
worth every penny 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
dont do it 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
love it great armband 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
sending it back 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
this case seems well made 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
disappointed 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
we loved the place 1 
did not like at all 0 
these are fabulous 1 
nice leather 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
very very fun chef 1 
it was a great phone 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i was so insulted 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
good works fine 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
i love this thing 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
works for me 1 
excellent phone 1 
my order was not correct 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
wont go back 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
kind of flops around 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
great brunch spot 1 
not easy to watch 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
very displeased 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
very disappointed 0 
does everything it should and more 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
it just blew 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
awful 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
soggy and not good 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
very happy with this product 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
what a waste 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this place is amazing 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
that was nice 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
easy to use 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
great brunch spot 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the food is good 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
does not fit 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the mic is great 1 
excellent 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
very bad experience 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
last time buying from you 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
portable and it works 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
worst customer service 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
very friendly staff 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
great brunch spot 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
what a waste of time 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the acting sucked 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
great choice 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
great hands free device 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
this is a great little item 1 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i loved it 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
nothing new there 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
worthless product 0 
the service was meh 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
excellent short film 1 
good price 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
bad reception 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
brilliant 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i want my money back 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
its just painful 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
bad purchase 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
krussel always good 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
dont buy it 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
very disappointing 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
very good phone 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
this place lacked style 0 
great phone 1 
again no plot at all 0 
good case 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
item does not match picture 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it was packed 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this case seems well made 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
happy so far 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
great phone 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
not enough volume 0 
worst ever 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
worth every penny 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
just what i wanted 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
love this headset 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
has been working great 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
i wont be back 0 
nice leather 1 
highly recommended 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
piece of junk 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
will order from them again 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
warning stay away 0 
great for ipods too 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
great value 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
used and dirty 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
1010 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
worked great 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this place has it 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
warning stay away 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
very good phone 1 
really bad 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
omit watching this 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
nothing new there 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the poor actors 0 
item does not match picture 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
it worked very well 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
overall a delight 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
excellent short film 1 
omit watching this 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
works well 1 
bad choice 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
excellent service 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
disappointed 0 
very displeased 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i will not return 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i love it 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
poor sound quality 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
piece of junk 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
everything is appalling 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
not good for the money 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i am very happy 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
con spotty service 0 
really ugly 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
love this product 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
not enough volume 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the battery works great 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
this place is great 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
service was very prompt 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
excellent 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
give this one a look 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it was a great phone 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
the poor actors 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
works great 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
great hands free device 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
everything was gross 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
will definitely be back 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
soggy and not good 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
i am very happy 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
youll love it 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
it was not good 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
low quality 0 
an hour seriously 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
very funny 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
this place is amazing 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0

so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it was a great phone 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
works fine 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i wont be back 0

it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i love this place 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the best phone in market 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the best phone in market 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
its really easy 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the fries were great too 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
there is no real plot 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
i think not again 0 
worst customer service 0 
does not fit 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
fast service 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
battery life is also great 1 
great phone 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
never got it 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
great phone 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
will not be back 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
good transmit audio 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
we loved the place 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
service sucks 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
great audio 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
it worked very well 1 
worthwhile 1 
youll love it 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
not my thing 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
and it was boring 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
great hands free device 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
great case and price 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1
