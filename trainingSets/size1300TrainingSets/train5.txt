comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
great choice 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
awesome device 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
highly recommended 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
there is no real plot 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
simply beautiful 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
overall a delight 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
its not user friendly 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
disapointing results 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the phone loads super 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
i love this device 1 
defective crap 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
but its just not funny 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
great product 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
will order from them again 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the acting sucked 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
very disappointed 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
so bad 0 
great for ipods too 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
incredible 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
will be back again 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
highly recommended a 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
extremely tasty 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
that was nice 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i loved it 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
you cant beat that 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
but its just not funny 0 
what a waste 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
a good time 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
did not like at all 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
really ugly 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
good show samsung 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
love this product 1 
how stupid is that 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
dont buy this product 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
will never ever go back 0 
poor quality and service 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
it deserves strong love 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
a great touch 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
awful service 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
disappointed 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
everything was gross 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
excellent short film 1 
it was not good 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the design is very good4 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
very very sad 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
youll love it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
disappointing 0 
highly recommended 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it is a true classic 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
highly recommended a 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
absolutely great 1 
overall a delight 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
waste of money 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
dont miss it 1 
poor product 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
awsome device works great 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
damn good steak 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
what a mistake 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
never got it 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
awful 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i am very happy 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
wont go back 0 
youll love it 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
they were excellent 1 
warning do not buy 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
very good phone 1 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
dont buy it 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i never come again 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
that company is a joke 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
good value great food great service 1 
this is a great little item 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
kind of flops around 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
poor sound quality 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
not my thing 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the food was terrible 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
worst martini ever 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
very disappointed 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
disappointed 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
horrible phone 0 
good transmit audio 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
its a great item 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
i was very disappointed 0 
great phone 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
piece of junk 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
check it out 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
waste of money 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the management is rude 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this game rocks 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
does not work 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
disappointing 0 
love this product 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
poor product 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
buttons are too small 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
happy so far 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
see both films if you can 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
battery is terrible 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this place is great 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
go watch it 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
it was delicious 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i would recommend this 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
nothing special 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
good prices 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it looks very nice 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
youll love it 1 
awful service 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
good case excellent value 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i wont be back 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
omit watching this 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
the fries were great too 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
doesnt last long 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
used and dirty 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
stay away from the q 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
go watch it 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
we are sending it back 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the food was terrible 0 
doesnt last long 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
item does not match picture 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
better than youd expect 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
this is infuriating 0 
great price also 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
i wont be back 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
not impressed 0 
very good phone 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
cumbersome design 0 
too politically correct 0 
it worked very well 1 
they were excellent 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
easy to use 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
works good 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
good item low price 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
great phone 1 
it is shameful 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
great charger 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
yes its that bad 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
it is not good 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i paid too much 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
nothing new there 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
it is an insane game 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
not recommended 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
will be back again 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
the food was terrible 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
what a disappointment 0 
it was equally awful 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
incredible 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
so just beware 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the battery works great 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
bad reception 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
its very slow 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
so bad 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
great bluetooth 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
nice ambiance 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
so just beware 0 
how stupid is that 0 
we are sending it back 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
its a total package 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
how stupid is that 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
so just beware 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
both great 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great earpiece 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
everything stinks 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
works for me 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
we loved the place 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
that company is a joke 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
really ugly 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
bad choice 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i never come again 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
really awful 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
its just painful 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
really good product 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
works well 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
cool phone 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
its not user friendly 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
go watch it 1 
cool phone 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
good servicecheck 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
this is just a great movie 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i never come again 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
excellent phone 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
the film is way too long 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1
