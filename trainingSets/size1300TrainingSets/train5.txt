it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
terrible service 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
cumbersome design 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
last time buying from you 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
great service and food 1 
everything stinks 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
its very slow 0 
does not fit 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
great value 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
an hour seriously 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
very disappointing 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
you wont regret it 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
works great 1 
was not happy 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
im returning them 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
dont miss it 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
disappointing experience 0 
crust is not good 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i love this phone 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
disappointed 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
no complaints 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
how awful she is 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
bad choice 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
owners are really great people 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
worst thai ever 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
both great 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
con spotty service 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
great phone 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
good quality 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i would recommend it 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
really good product 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i was so insulted 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
good audio quality 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
this place is great 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
dont go here 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
awesome device 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
kind of flops around 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this case seems well made 1 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i paid too much 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
not enough volume 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
sooooo good 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
not impressed 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
just what i wanted 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
too politically correct 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
totally believable 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
sooooo good 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
great phone 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
awful 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
its a total package 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
this pda rocks 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
damn good steak 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
not good for the money 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
good product incredible value 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the cast is good 1 
food was really boring 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
service stinks here 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
poor product 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
great brunch spot 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
im returning them 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the management is rude 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
give this one a look 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
truly awful 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
sending it back 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
great phone 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
this is infuriating 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
worthless product 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
would not reccommend 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
total brunch fail 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the poor actors 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
does not fit 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i liked it 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
see it 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
that company is a joke 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
design flaw 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
fast service 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
worked perfectly 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
does not fit 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
would recommend this item 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
this movie is bad 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
great sound and service 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
the design is very good4 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
i love this place 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
total waste of time 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
great audio 1 
really bad 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
worked great 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it just blew 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
its not user friendly 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
we loved the place 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it is shameful 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
over rated 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
we loved the place 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
im returning them 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
very disappointing 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
so far so good 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
see it 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
great phone 1 
the mic is great 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
con spotty service 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is a good joint 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
price is good too 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
excellent short film 1 
its aggravating 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
you wont regret it 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
dont go here 0 
excellent 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i love this phone 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is a great phone 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
worst thai ever 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
sending it back 0 
very very sad 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it was horrendous 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
the cast is good 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
awful 0 
great product 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
really awful 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
i really liked that 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
did not like at all 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it was delicious 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
food was average at best 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
its really easy 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
really good product 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
disappointing experience 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
great food 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
these are fabulous 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the film is way too long 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
cumbersome design 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
not my thing 0 
excellent short film 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
this case seems well made 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the phone loads super 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
awful 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
really ugly 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
great value 1 
i would recommend it 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i paid too much 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
i love this place 1 
the poor actors 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
totally believable 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
its aggravating 0 
battery life is real good 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
food was really boring 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
poor product 0 
its just lame 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
works well 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
would recommend this item 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
sweetest phone 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
bad reception 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
it looks very nice 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
everything was gross 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
a standout scene 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1
